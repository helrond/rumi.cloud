Yea, its strains lay bare my inmost secrets.","Who hath seen a poison and an antidote like the flute?","Who hath seen a sympathetic consoler like the flute?","The flute tells the tale of loves bloodstained path, it recounts the story of Majnuns love toils.","None is privy to these feelings save one distracted, as ear inclines to the whispers of the tongue.","Through grief my days are as labor and sorrow, my days move on, hand in hand with anguish.","Yet, though my days vanish thus, tis no matter, do thou abide, O Incomparable Pure One!","But all who are not fishes are soon tired of water; And they who lack daily bread find the day very long; So the Raw comprehend not the state of the Ripe; Therefore it behoves me to shorten my discourse.","Arise, O son!","burst thy bonds and be free!","How long wilt thou be captive to silver and gold?","Though thou pour the ocean into thy pitcher, it can hold no more than one days store.","The pitcher of the desire of the covetous never fills, the oyster-shell fills not with pearls till it is content; Only he whose garment is rent by the violence of love is wholly pure from covetousness and sin.","Hail to thee, then, O LOVE, sweet madness!","Thou who healest all our infirmities!","Who art the physician of our pride and self-conceit!","Who art our Plato and our Galen!","Love exalts our earthly bodies to heaven, and makes the very hills to dance with joy!","lover, twas love that gave life to Mount Sinai, when it quaked, and Moses fell down in a swoon.","Did my Beloved only touch me with his lips, i too, like the flute, would burst out in melody.","But he who is parted from them that speak his tongue, though he possess a hundred voices, is perforce dumb.","When the rose has faded and the garden is withered, the song of the nightingale is no longer to be heard.","The BELOVED is all in all, the lover only veils Him; The BELOVED is all that lives, the lover a dead thing.","When the lover feels no longer LOVEs quickening, he becomes like a bird who has lost its wings.","Alas!","How can I retain my senses about me, when the BELOVED shows not the light of His countenance?","LOVE desires that this secret should be revealed, for if a mirror reflects not, of what use is it?","Knowest thou why thy mirror reflects not?","Because the rust has not been scoured from its face.","If it were purified from all rust and defilement, it would reflect the shining of the SUN Of GOD.","O friends, ye have now heard this tale, which sets forth the very essence of my case.","A true lover is proved such by his pain of heart; No sickness is there like sickness of heart.","The lovers ailment is different from all ailments; Love is the astrolabe of Gods mysteries.","A lover may hanker after this love or that love, but at the last he is drawn to the KING of love.","However much we describe and explain love, when we fall in love we are ashamed of our words.","Explanation by the tongue makes most things clear, but love unexplained is clearer.","When pen hasted to write, on reaching the subject of love it split in twain.","When the discourse touched on the matter of love, pen was broken and paper forn.","In explaining it Reason sticks fast, as an ass in mire; Naught but Love itself can explain love and lovers!","None but the sun can display the sun, if you would see it displayed, turn not away from it.","Shadows, indeed, may indicate the suns presence, but only the sun displays the light of life.","Shadows induce slumber, like evening talks, but when the sun arises the moon is split asunder.","In the world there is naught so wondrous as the sun, but the Sun of the soul sets not and has no yesterday.","Though the material sun is unique and single, we can conceive similar suns like to it.","But the Sun of the soul, beyond this firmament, no like thereof is seen in concrete or abstract.","Where is there room in conception for His essence, so that similitudes of HIM should be conceivable?","Shamsu-d-Din of Tabriz importunes jalalu- d-Din to compose the Masnavi.","The sun (Shams) of Tabriz is a perfect light, a sun, yea, one of the beams of God!","When the praise was heard of the Sun of Tabriz, The sun of the fourth heaven bowed its head.","Now that I have mentioned his name, it is but right to set forth some indications of his beneficence.","That precious Soul caught my skirt, smelling the perfume of the garment of Yusuf; And said, For the sake of our ancient friendship, tell forth a hint of those sweet states of ecstasy, that earth and heaven may be rejoiced, and also Reason and Spirit, a hundredfold.","I said, O thou who art far from The Friend, Like a sick man who has strayed from his physician, importune me not, for I am beside myself; My understanding is gone, I cannot sing praises.","Whatsoever one says, whose reason is thus astray, let him not boast; his efforts are useless.","Whatever he says is not to the point, and is clearly inapt and wide of the mark.","What can I say when not a nerve of mine is sensible?","Can I explain The Friend to one to whom He is no Friend?","Verily my singing His praise were dispraise, for twould prove me existent, and existence is error.","Can I describe my separation and my bleeding heart?","Nay, put off this matter till another season.","He said,  Feed me, for I am an hungered, and at once, for the time is a sharp sword.","comrade, the Sufi is the son of time present.","It is not the rule of his canon to say, To-morrow.","Can it be that thou art not a true Sufi?","Ready money is lost by giving credit.","I said, Tis best to veil the secrets of The Friend.","So give good heed to the morals of these stories.","That is better than that the secrets of The Friend Should be noised abroad in the talk of strangers.","He said, Without veil or covering or deception, speak out, and vex me not, O man of many words!","Strip off the veil and speak out, for do not I enter under the same coverlet as the Beloved?","I said, If the Beloved were exposed to outward view, neither wouldst thou endure, nor embrace, nor form.","Press thy suit, yet with moderation; A blade of grass cannot, pierce a mountain.","If the sun that illumines the world were to draw nigher, the world would be consumed.","Close thy mouth and shut the eyes of this matter, that, the worlds life be not made a bleeding heart.","No longer seek this peril, this bloodshed; Hereafter impose silence on the Sun of Tabriz.","He said, Thy words are endless.","Now tell forth all thy story from its beginning.","Worldly senses are the ladder of earth, spiritual senses are the ladder of heaven.","The health of the former is sought of the leech, the health of the latter from The Friend.","The health of the former arises from tending the body, that of the latter from mortifying the flesh.","The kingly soul lays waste the body, and after its destruction he builds it anew.","Happy the soul who for love of God has lavished family, wealth, and goods!","Has destroyed its house to find the hidden treasure, and with that treasure has rebuilt it in fairer sort; Has dammed up the stream and cleansed the channel, and then turned a fresh stream into, the channel; Has cut its flesh to extract a spear-head, causing a fresh skin to grow again over the wound; Has razed the fort to oust, the infidel in possession, and then rebuilt it with a hundred towers and bulwarks.","Who can describe the unique work of Grace?","I have been forced to illustrate it by these similes.","Sometimes it presents one appearance, sometimes another.","Yea, the affair of religion is only bewilderment.","Not, such as occurs when one turns ones back on God, but such as when one is drowned and absorbed in Him.","The latter has his face ever turned to God, the formers face shows his undisciplined self-will.","Watch the face of each one, regard it well, it may be by serving thou wilt recognize Truths face.","As there are many demons with mens faces, it is wrong to join hand with every one.","When the fowler sounds his decoy whistle, that the birds may be beguiled by that snare, the birds hear that call simulating a birds call, and, descending from the air, find net and knife.","So vile hypocrites steal the language of Darveshes, in order to beguile the simple with their trickery.","The works of the righteous are light and heat, the works of the evil treachery and shamelessness.","They make stuffed lions to scare the simple, they give the title of Muhammad to false Musailima.","But Musailma retained the name of Liar, And Muhammad that of Sublimest of beings.","That wine of God (the righteous) yields a perfume of musk; Other wine (the evil) is reserved for penalties and pains.","Myriads of Christians flocked round him, one after another they assembled in his street.","Then he would preach to them of mysteries, mysteries of the Gospel, of stoles, of prayers.","He would preach to them with eloquent words concerning the words and acts of the Messiah.","Outwardly he was a preacher of religious duties, but within a decoy call and a fowlers snare.","Therefore the followers of the Prophet (Isa) Were beguiled by the fraud of that demon soul.","He mingled in his discourses many secret doctrines concerning devotion and sincerity of soul.","He taught them to make a fair show of devotion, but to say of secret sins, What do they matter?","Hair by hair and jot by jot they learned of him fraud of soul, as roses might learn of garlic.","Hair-splitters and all their disciples are darkened by similar preaching and discourse.","The Christians gave their hearts to him entirely, for the blind faith of the vulgar has no discernment.","In their inmost breasts they planted love of him, and fancied him to be the Vicar of Christ; Yea, him, that one-eyed and cursed Dajjal!","Save us.","O God","who art our only defender!","O God, there are hundreds of snares and baits, and we are even as greedy and foolish birds; Every moment our feet are caught in a fresh snare; Yea, each one of us, though he be a falcon or Simurgh!","Thou dost release us every moment, and straightway we again fly into the snare, O Almighty One!","Every night Thou freest our spirits from the body and its snare, making them pure as rased tablets.","Every night spirits are released from this cage, and set free, neither lording it nor lorded over.","At night prisoners are unaware of their prison, at night kings are unaware of their majesty.","Then there is no thought or care for loss or gain, no regard to such an one or such an one.","The state of the Knower is such as this, even when awake.","God says, Thou wouldst deem him awake though asleep, sleeping to the affairs of the world, day and night, like a pen in the directing hand of the writer.","He who sees not the hand which effects the writing fancies the effect proceeds from the motion of the pen.","If the Knower revealed the particulars of this state, Twould rob the vulgar of their sensual sleep.","His soul wanders in the desert that has no similitude; Like his body, his spirit is enjoying perfect rest; Freed from desire of eating and drinking, like a bird escaped from cage and snare.","But when he is again beguiled into the snare, he cries for help to the Almighty.","Laila and the Khalifa.","The Khalifa said to Laila, Art thou really she for whom Majnun lost his head and went distracted?","Thou art not fairer than many other fair ones.","She replied, Be silent; thou art not Majnun!","If thou hadst Majnuns eyes, the two worlds would be within thy view.","Thou art in thy senses, but Majnun is beside himself.","In love to be wide awake is treason.","The more a man is awake, the more he sleeps (to love); His (critical) wakefulness is worse than slumbering.","Our wakefulness fetters our spirits, then our souls are a prey to divers whims, thoughts of loss and gain and fears of misery.","They retain not purity, nor dignity, nor lustre, nor aspiration to soar heavenwards.","That one is really sleeping who hankers after each whim and holds parley with each fancy.","He drew up a separate scroll to the address of each, the contents of each scroll of a different tenor; The rules of each of a different purport, this contradictory of that, from beginning to end.","In one the road of fasting and asceticism was made the pillar and condition of right devotion.","In one twas said, Abstinence profits not; Sincerity in this path is naught but charity.","In one twas said, Thy fasting and thy charity are both a making thyself equal with God; Save faith and utter resignation to Gods will in weal and woe, all virtues are fraud and snares.","In one twas said, Works are the one thing needful; The doctrine of faith without works is a delusion.","In one twas said, Commands and prohibitions are not for observance, but to demonstrate our weakness, that we may see our own weakness (to carry them out), and thereby recognize and confess Gods power.","In one twas said, Reference to thine own weakness is ingratitude for Gods mercies towards us.","Rather regard thy power, for thou hast power from God.","Know thy power to be Gods grace, for tis of Him.","In one twas said, Leave power and weakness alone; Whatever withdraws thine eyes from God is an idol.","In one twas said, Quench not thy earthy forch, that it may be a light to lighten mankind.","If thou neglectest regard and care for it, thou wilt quench at midnight the lamp of union.","In one twas said, Quench that forch without fear, that in lieu of one thou mayst see a thousand joys, for by quenching the light the soul is rejoiced, and thy Laila is then as bold as her Majnun.","Whoso to display his devotion renounces the world, the world is ever with him, before and behind.","In one twas said, Whatsoever God has given thee in His creation, that He has made sweet to thee; Yea, pleasant to thee and allowable.","Take it, then, and cast not thyself into the pangs of abstinence.","In one twas said, Give up all thou possessest, for to be ruled by covetousness is grievous sin.","(Ah!","how many diverse roads are pointed out, and each followed by some sect for dear life!","If the right road were easily attainable, every Jew and Gueber would have hit on it!) In one twas said, The right road is attainable, for the hearts life is the food of the soul.","Whatever is enjoyed by the carnal man yields no fruit, even as salt and waste land.","Its result is naught but remorse, its traffic yields only loss.","It is not profitable in the long run; Its name is called bankrupt in the upshot.","Discern, then, the bankrupt from the profitable, consider the eventual value of this and that.","In one twas said, Choose ye a wise Director, but foresight of results is not found in dignities.","In one twas said, Thyself art thy master, inasmuch as thou art acquainted with the Master of all; Be a man, and not another mans beast of burden!","Follow thine own way and lose not thy head!","In one twas said, All we see is One.","Whoever says tis two is suffering from double vision.","In one twas said, A hundred are even as one.","But whoso thinks this is a.","madman.","Each scroll had its contrary piece of rhetoric, in form and substance utterly opposed to it; This contrary to that, from first to last, as if each was compounded of poison and antidotes.","Air, earth, water, and fire are Gods servants.","To us they seem lifeless, but to God living.","In Gods presence fire ever waits to do its service, like a submissive lover with no will of its own.","When you strike steel on flint fire leaps forth; But tis by Gods command it thus steps forth.","Strike not together the flint and steel of wrong, for the pair will generate more, like man and woman.","The flint and steel are themselves causes, yet look higher for the First Cause, O righteous man!","For that Cause precedes this second cause.","How can a cause exist of itself without precedent cause?","That Cause makes this cause operative, and again helpless and inoperative.","That Cause, which is a guiding light to the prophets, that, I say, is higher than these second causes.","Mens minds recognize these second causes, but only prophets perceive the action of the First Cause.","Praise compared to vapour drawn upwards, and then descending in rain.","Though water be enclosed in a reservoir, yet air will absorb it, for tis its supporter; It sets it free and bears it to its source, little by little, so that you see not the process.","In like manner this breath of ours by degrees steals away our souls from the prison-house of earth.","The good word riseth up to Him, Rising from us whither He knoweth.","Our breathings are lifted up in fear of God, offerings from us to the throne of Eternity.","Then come down to us rewards for our praises, the double thereof, yea, mercies from the King of Glory.","Therefore are we constrained to utter these praises that slaves may attain the height of Gods gifts.","And so this rising and descent go on evermore, and cease not forever and aye.","To speak in plain Persian, this attraction comes from the same quarter whence comes this sweet savour.","The beasts said, O enlightened sage, lay aside caution; it cannot help thee against destiny; To worry with precaution is toil and moil; Go, trust in Providence, trust is the better part.","War not with the divine decree, O hot-headed one, lest that decree enter into conflict with thee.","Man should be as dead before the commands of God lest a blow befall him from the Lord of all creatures.","He said, True; but though trust be our mainstay, yet the Prophet teaches us to have regard to means.","The Prophet cried with a loud voice, Trust in God, yet tie the camels leg.","Hear the adage, The worker is the friend of God; Through trust in Providence neglect not to use means.","Go, O Quietists, practice trust with self-exertion, exert yourself to attain your objects, bit by bit.","In order to succeed, strive and exert yourselves; If ye strive not for your objects, ye are fools.","They said, What is gained from the poor by exertions is a fraudulent morsel that will bring ill luck.","Again, know that self-exertion springs from weakness; Relying on other means is a blot upon perfect trust.","Self-exertion is not more noble than trust in God.","What is more lovely than committing oneself to God?","Many there are who flee from one danger to a worse; Many flee from a snake and meet a dragon.","Man plans a stratagem, and thereby snares himself; What he takes for life turns out, to be destruction.","He shuts the door after his foe is in the house.","After this sort were the schemes of Pharaoh.","That jealous king slew a myriad babes, while Moses, whom he sought, was in his house.","Our eyes are subject to many infirmities; Go!","annihilate your sight in Gods sight.","For our foresight His foresight is a fair exchange; In His sight is all that ye can desire.","So long as a babe cannot grasp or run, it takes its fathers back for its carriage.","But when it becomes independent and uses its hands, it falls into grievous troubles and disgrace.","The souls of our first parents, even before their hands, flew away from fidelity after vain pleasure.","Being made captives by the command, Get down hence, they became bond-slaves of enmity, lust, and vanity.","We are the family of the Lord and His sucking babes.","The Prophet said, The people are Gods family; He who sends forth the rain from heaven, can He not also provide us our daily bread?","The lion said, True; yet the Lord of creatures sets a ladder before our feet.","Step by step must we mount up to the roof!","The notion of fatalism is groundless in this place.","Ye have feet why then pretend ye are lame?","Ye have hands why then conceal your claws?","When a master places a spade in the hand of a slave, the slave knows his meaning without being told.","Like this spade, our hands are our Masters hints to us; Yea, if ye consider, they are His directions to us.","When ye have taken to heart His hints, ye will shape your life in reliance on their direction; Wherefore these hints disclose His intent, take the burden from you, and appoint your work.","He that bears it makes it bearable by you, he that is able makes it within your ability.","Accept His command, and you will be able to execute it; Seek union with Him, and you will find yourselves united.","Exertion is giving thanks for Gods blessings; Think ye that your fatalism gives such thanks?","Giving thanks for blessings increases blessings, but fatalism snatches those blessings from your hands.","Your fatalism is to sleep on the road; sleep not till ye behold the gates of the Kings palace.","Ah!","sleep not, O unreflecting fatalists, till ye have reached that fruit-laden Tree of Life whose branches are ever shaken by the wind, and whose fruit is showered on the sleepers heads.","Fatalism means sleeping amidst highwaymen.","Can a cock who crows too soon expect peace?","If ye cavil at and accept not Gods hints, though ye count yourselves men, see, ye are women.","The quantum of reason ye possessed is lost, and the head whose reason has fled is a tail.","Inasmuch as the unthankful are despicable, they are at last cast into the fiery pit.","If ye really have trust in God, exert yourselves, and strive, in constant reliance on the Almighty.","Wisdom is granted often times to the weak.","He said, O friends, God has given me inspiration.","Often times strong counsel is suggested to the weak.","The wit taught by God to the bee is withheld from the lion and the wild ass.","It fills its cells with liquid sweets, for God opens the door of this knowledge to it.","The skill taught by God to the silkworm is a learning beyond the reach of the elephant.","The earthly Adam was taught of God names, so that his glory reached the seventh heaven.","He laid low the name and fame of the angels, yet blind indeed are they whom God dooms to doubt!","The devotee of seven hundred thousand years (Satan) Was made a muzzle for that yearling calf (Adam), lest he should suck milk of the knowledge of faith, and soar on high even to the towers of heaven.","The knowledge of men of external sense is a muzzle to stop them sucking milk of that sublime knowledge.","But God drops into the heart a single pearl-drop which is not bestowed on oceans or skies!","How long regard ye mere form, O form-worshippers?","Your souls, void of substance, rest still in forms.","If the form of man were all that made man, ahmad and Abu Jahl would be upon a par.","A painting on a wall resembles a man, but see what it is lacking in that empty form.","Tis life that is lacking to that mere semblance of man.","Go!","seek for that pearl it never will find.","The heads of earths lions were bowed down when God gave might to the Seven Sleepers dog.","What mattered its despised form when its soul was drowned in the sea of light?","Human wisdom, the manifestation of divine.","On his way to the lion the hare lingered, devising a stratagem with himself.","He proceeded on his way after delaying long, in order to have a secret or two for the lion.","What worlds the principle of Reason embraces!","How broad is this ocean of Reason!","Yea, the Reason of man is a boundless ocean.","O son, that ocean requires, as it were, a diver.","On this fair ocean our human forms float about, like bowls on the surface of water; Yea like cups on the surface, till they are.","filled; And when filled, these cups sink into the water.","The ocean of Reason is not seen ; reasoning men are seen; But our forms (minds) are only as waves or spray there-of.","Whatever form that ocean uses as its instrument, therewith it casts its spray far and wide.","Till the heart sees the Giver of the secret, till it espies that Bowman shooting from afar, it fancies its own steed lost, while in bewilderment it is urging that steed hither and thither; It fancies its own steed lost, when all the while that swift steed is bearing it on like the wind.","In deep distress that blunder head runs from door to door, searching and inquiring, Who and where is he that hath stolen my steed?","They say, What is this thou ridest on, O master?","He says, True, tis a steed; but where is mine?","They say, Look to thyself, O rider; thy steed is there.","The real Soul is lost to view, and seems far off; Thou art like a pitcher with full belly but dry lip; How canst thou ever see red, green, and scarlet unless thou seest the light first of all?","When thy sight is dazzled by colors, these colors veil the light from thee.","But when night veils those colors from thee, thou seest that colors are seen only through light.","As there is no seeing outward colors without light, so it is with the mental colors within.","Outward colors arise from the light of sun and stars, and inward colors from the Light on high.","The light that lights the eye is also the hearts Light; The eyes light proceeds from the Light of the heart.","But the light that lights the heart is the Light of God, which is distinct from the light of reason and sense.","At night there is no light, and colors are not seen; Hence we know what light is by its opposite, darkness.","At night no colors are visible, for light is lacking.","How can color be the attribute of dark blackness?","Looking on light is the same as looking on colors; Opposite shows up opposite, as a Frank a Negro.","The opposite of light shows what is light, hence colors too are known by their opposite.","God created pain and grief for this purpose, to wit, to manifest happiness by its opposites.","Hidden things are manifested by their opposites; But, as God has no opposite.","He remains hidden.","Gods light has no opposite in the range of creation whereby it may be manifested to view.","Perforce Our eyes see not Him, though He sees us.","Behold this in the case of Moses and Mount Sinai.","Discern form from substance, as lion from desert, or as sound and speech from the thought they convey.","The sound and speech arise from the thought; Thou knowest not where is the Ocean of thought; Yet when thou seest fair waves of speech, thou knowest there is a glorious Ocean beneath them.","When waves of thought arise from the Ocean of Wisdom, they assume the forms of sound and speech.","These forms of speech are born and die again, these wa,ves cast themselves back into the Ocean.","Form is born of That which is without form, and goes again, for, Verily to Him do we return.","Wherefore to thee every moment come death and return.","Mustafa saith, The world endureth only a moment.","So, thought is an arrow shot by God into the air.","How can it stay in the air?","It returns to God.","Every moment the world and we are renewed, yet we are ignorant of this renewing forever and aye.","Life, like a stream of water, is renewed and renewed, though it wears the appearance of continuity in form.","That seeming continuity arises from its swift renewal, as when a single spark of fire is whirled round swiftly.","If a single spark be whirled round swiftly, it seems to the eye a continuous line of fire.","This apparent extension, owing to the quick motion, demonstrates the rapidity with which it is moved.","If ye seek the deepest student of this mystery, lo!","tis Husamu-d-Din, the most exalted of creatures!","The ambassador said, O Commander of the faithful, how comes the soul down from above to earth?","How can so noble a bird be confined in a cage?","He said, God speaks words of power to souls, to things of naught, without eyes or ears, and at these words they all spring into motion; At His words of power these nothings arise quickly, and strong impulse urges them into existence.","Again, He speaks other spells to these creatures, and swiftly drives them back again into Not-being.","He speaks to the roses ear, and causes it to bloom; He speaks to the tulip, and makes it blossom.","He speaks a spell to body, and it becomes soul; He speaks to the sun, and it becomes a fount of light.","Again, in its ear He whispers a word of power, and its face is darkened as by a hundred eclipses.","What is it that God says to the ear of earth, that it attends thereto and rests steadfast?","What is it that Speaker says to the cloud, that it pours forth rain-water like a water-skin?","Whosoever is bewildered by wavering will, in his ear hath God whispered His riddle, that He may bind him on the horns of a dilemma; For he says, Shall I do this or its reverse?","Also from God comes the preference of one alternative; Tis from Gods impulsion that man chooses one of the two.","If you desire sanity in this embarrassment, stuff not the ear of your mind with cotton.","Take the cotton of evil suggestions from the minds ear, that the heavenly voice from above may enter it, that you may understand that riddle of His, that you may be cognisant of that open secret.","Then the minds ear becomes the sensorium of inspiration; For what is this Divine voice but the inward voice?","The spirits eye and ear possess this sense, the eye and ear of reason and sense lack it.","The word compulsion makes me impatient for loves sake; Tis he who loves not who is fettered by compulsion.","This is close communion with God, not compulsion, the shining of the sun, and not a dark cloud.","Or, if it be compulsion, tis not common compulsion, it is not the domination of wanton wilfulness.","O son, they understand this compulsion for whom God opens the eyes of the inner man.","Things hidden and things future are plain to them; To speak of the past seems to them despicable.","They possess freewill and compulsion besides, as in oyster-shells raindrops are pearls.","Outside the shell they are raindrops, great and small; Inside they are precious pearls, big and little.","These men also resemble the musk deers bag; Outside it is blood, but inside pure musk; Yet, say not that outside twas mere blood, which on entering the bag becomes musk.","Nor say that outside the alembic twas mere copper, and becomes gold inside, when mixed with elixir.","In you freewill and compulsion are vain fancies, but in them they are the light of Almighty power.","On the table bread is a mere lifeless thing, when taken into the body it is a life-giving spirit.","This transmutation occurs not in the tables heart, Tis soul effects this transmutation with water of life.","Such is the power of the soul, O man of right views!","Then what is the power of the Soul of souls?","(God).","Bread is the food of the body, yet consider, how can it be the food of the soul, O son?","Flesh-born man by force of soul cleaves mountains with tunnels and mines.","The might of Ferhads soul cleft a hill; The might of the Souls soul cleaves the moon; If the heart opens the mouth of mysterys store, the soul springs up swiftly to highest heaven.","If tongue discourses of hidden mysteries, it kindles a fire that consumes the world.","Behold, then, Gods action and mans action; Know, action does belong to us ; this is evident.","If no actions proceeded from men, how could you say, Why act ye thus?","The agency of God is the cause of our action, our actions are the signs of Gods agency; Nevertheless our actions are freely willed by us, whence our recompense is either hell or The Friend.","As to a man of heart, he takes no hurt, even though he should eat deadly poison.","He who gains health from practicing abstinence is safe; The poor disciple is safe in the midst of fever.","The prophet said, O disciple, though you be bold, yet enter not into conflict with every foe.","Within you is a Nimrod; enter not his fire; But if you must do so, first become an Abraham.","If you are neither swimmer nor seaman, cast not yourself into the sea out of self-conceit.","A swimmer brings pearls from the deep sea; Yea, he plucks gain from the midst of perils.","If the saint handles earth, it becomes gold; If a sinner handles gold, it turns to dust.","Whereas the saint is well-pleasing to God, in his actions his hand is the hand of God.","But the sinners hand is the hand of Satan and demons, because he is ensnared in falsity and fraud.","If folly meets him, he takes it for wisdom; Yea, the learning gained by the wicked is folly.","Whatever a sick man eats is a source of sickness, but if a saint imbibe infidelity it becomes faith.","Ah!","footman who contendest with horsemen, thou wilt not succeed in carrying the day!","The whole world is jealous for this cause, that God surpasseth the world in jealousy.","God is as a soul and the world as a body, and bodies derive their good and evil from souls.","He to whom the sanctuary of true prayer is revealed deems it shameful to turn back to mere formal religion.","He who is master of the robes of a king brings shame on his lord by petty huckstering.","He who is admitted to the kings presence-chamber would show disrespect by tarrying at the doorway.","If the king grants him license to kiss his hand, he would err were he to kiss merely the kings foot.","Though to lay head at the kings feet is due obeisance, in the case supposed it would be wrong to kiss the feet.","The kings jealousy would be kindled against him who, after he had seen his face, preferred his mere perfume.","Gods jealousy may be likened to a grain of wheat, but mans jealousy is but empty chaff.","For know ye that the source of jealousy is in God, and mans jealousy is only an offshoot from Gods.","But, let me now quit this subject, and make complaint of the severity of That Fickle Fair One.","Wherefore dost thou abandon thy creed and faith?","What matters it if it be heathen or true?","Why hast thou forsaken thy Beloved?","What matters it if she be fair or ugly?","Let me then, I say, make complaint of the severity of That Fickle Fair One.","I cry, and my cries sound sweet in His ear;

He who drinks fermented whey displays drunkenness, makes a noise, and reels to and fro.","That hypocrite in prayers and fasts displays exceeding diligence, that men may think him drunk with love of God;

He said, What are ye saying at such length?","What ye give tongue to so foolishly is as the words of spoiled children to their father.","I knew of myself what ye thought, but I desired that ye should speak it; As this boasting of yours is very improper, so shall my mercy be shown to prevail over my wrath: angels, in order to show forth that prevailing, i inspired that pretension to cavil and doubt; If you say your say, and I forbear to punish you, the gainsayers of my mercy must hold their peace.","My mercy equals that of a hundred fathers and mothers; Every soul that is born is amazed thereat.","Their mercy is as the foam of the sea of my mercy; It is mere foam of waves, but the sea abides ever!","What more shall I say?","In that earthly shell there is naught but foam of foam of foam of foam!","God is that foam;

She is vested with darkness and a gainsayer of reason.","Learn now whence springs the root of this circumstance, from this, that the Whole has parts of divers kinds.","These parts of the Whole are not parts in relation to it, not in the way that roses scent is a part of the rose.","The beauty of the green shoot is part of the roses beauty, but the turtle-doves cooing is a part of that Bulbuls music.","But if I engage in doubts and answers, how can I give water to thirsty souls?","Yet, if you are perplexed by Whole and finite parts, have patience, for patience is the key of joy.","Be abstinent, abstinent from vague thoughts, since there are lions in that desert (of thoughts).","Abstinence is the prince of medicines, as scratching only aggravates a scab.","Abstinence is certainly the root of medicine; Practise abstinence, see how it invigorates thy soul!","Accept this counsel and give ear thereto, that it may be to thee as an earring of gold!","Nay, not a mere earring, but that thou mayest be a mine of gold, or that thou mayest surpass moon and Pleiades.","First, know creation is in various forms; Souls are as various as the letters from Alif to Ya.","In this variety of letters there seems disorder, though in fact they agree in an integral unity.","In one aspect they are opposed, in another united;

And hide the roses beauty and the thorns shame, that men may not see the bloom of the one and the others shame, that common stone and pure ruby may appear all as one.","True, the Gardener knows the difference even in autumn, but the sight of One is better than the worlds sight.","That One Person is Himself the world, as He is the sun, and every star in heaven is a part of the sun.","That One Person is Himself the world, and the rest are all His dependents and parasites, O man!","He is the perfect world, yet He is single; He holds in hand the writing of the whole of existence.","Wherefore all forms and colours of beauty cry out, Good news!","good news!","Lo!","the spring is at hand!","If the blossoms did not shine as bright helmets, how could the fruits display their globes?","When the blossoms are shed the fruits come to a head, when tho body is destroyed the soul lifts up its head.","The fruit is the substance, the blossom only its form, blossom the good news, and fruit the promised boon.","When the blossoms fall the fruit appears, when the former vanish the fruit is tasted.","Till bread is broken, how can it serve as food?","Till the grapes are crushed, how can they yield wine?","Till citrons be pounded up with drugs, how can they afford healing to the sick?","The Prophet said to Ali, O Ali, thou art the Lion of God, a hero most valiant; Yet confide not in thy lion-like valour, but seek refuge under the palm-trees of the Truth.","Whoso takes obedience as his exemplar shares its proximity to the ineffable Presence.","Do thou seek to draw near to Reason; let not thy heart rely, like others, on thy own virtue and piety.","Come under the shadow of the Man of Reason, thou canst not find it in the road of the traditionists.","That man enjoys close proximity to Allah; Turn not away from obedience to him in any wise; For he makes the thorn a bed of roses, and gives sight to the eyes of the blind.","His shadow on earth is as that of Mount Qaf, his spirit is as a Simurgh soaring on high.","He lends aid to the slaves of the friends of God, and advances to high place them who seek him.","Were I to tell his praises till the last day, my words would not be too many nor admit of curtailment, he is the sun of the spirit, not that of the sky, for from his light men and angels draw life.","That sun is hidden in the form of a man, understand me!","Allah knows the truth.","O Ali, out of all forms of religious service choose thou the shadow of that dear friend of God!","Every man takes refuge in some form of service, and chooses for himself some asylum; Do thou seek refuge in the shadow of the wise man, that thou mayest escape thy fierce secret foes.","Of all forms of service this is fittest for thee; Thou shah surpass all who were before thee.","Having chosen thy Director, be submissive to him, even as Moses submitted to the commands of Khizr;

Dancing and clapping hands with songs of praise, singing with joy, Our Lord hath restored us to life!","Shedding their old skins and bones, as horsemen stirring up a cloud of dust.","All pressing on from Not-being to Being, on the last day, as well the thankful as the unthankful.","The Prophet whispered in the ear of my servant that one day he would sever my head from my neck.","The Prophet also warned by inspiration me, his friend, that the hand of my servant would destroy me.","My servant cried, O kill me first, that I may not become guilty of so grievous a sin!","I replied, Since my death is to come from thee, how can I balk the fateful decree?","He fell at my feet and cried, O gracious lord, for Gods sake cleave now my body in twain, that such an evil deed may not be wrought by me, and my soul burn with anguish for its beloved.","I replied, What Gods pen has written, it has written; In presence of its writings knowledge is confounded; There is no anger in my soul against thee, because I attribute not this deed to thee; Thou art Gods instrument.","Gods hand is the agent.","How can I chide or fret at Gods instrument?","He said, If this be so, why is there retaliation?","I answered, Tis from God, and tis Gods secret; If He shows displeasure at His own acts, from His displeasure He evolves a Paradise; He feels displeasure at His own acts, because He is a God of vengeance as of mercy.","In this city of events He is the Lord, in this realm He is the King who plans all events.","If He crushes His own instruments, he makes those crushed ones fair in His sight.","Know the great mystery of whatever verses we cancel, or cause you to forget, we substitute better for them.","Whatever law God cancels, He makes as a weed, and in its stead He brings forth a rose.","So night cancels the business of the daytime, when the reason that lights our minds becomes inanimate.","Again, night is cancelled by the light of day, and inanimate reason is rekindled to life by its rays.","Though darkness produces this sleep and quiet, is not the water of life in the darkness?","Are not spirits refreshed in that very darkness?","Is not that silence the season of heavenly voices?","For from contraries contraries are brought forth, out of darkness was created light.","The Prophets wars brought about the present peace, the peace of these latter days resulted from those wars.","That conqueror of hearts cut off a thousand heads, that the heads of his people might rest in peace.","Gods rebuke to Adam for scorning Iblis.","To whomsoever Gods order comes, he must smite with his sword even his own child.","Fear then, and revile not the wicked, for the wicked are impotent under Gods commands.","In presence of Gods commands bow down the neck of pride.","Scoff not nor chide even them that go astray!","One day Adam cast a look of contempt and scorn upon Iblis, thinking what a wretch he was.","He felt self-important and proud of himself, and he smiled at the actions of cursed Iblis.","God Almighty cried out to him, O pure one, thou art wholly ignorant of hidden mysteries.","If I were to blab the faults of the unfortunate, i should root up the mountains from their bases, and lay bare the secrets of a hundred Adams, and convert a hundred fresh Iblises into Mosalmans.","Adam answered, I repent me of my scornful looks; Such arrogant thoughts shall not be mine again.","Lord, pardon this rashness in Thy slave; I repent; chastise me not for these words!","O Aider of aid-seekers, guide us, for there is no security in knowledge or wealth; Lead not our hearts astray after Thou hast guided us, And avert the evil that the Pen has written.","Turn aside from our souls the evil written in our fates, repel us not from the tables of purity!","O God, Thy grace is the proper object of our desire; To couple others with Thee is not proper.","Nothing is bitterer than severance from Thee, without Thy shelter there is naught but perplexity.","Our worldly goods rob us of our heavenly goods, our body rends the garment of our soul.","Our hands, as it were, prey on our feet; Without reliance on Thee how can we live?","And if the soul escapes these great perils, it is made captive as a victim of misfortunes and fears, inasmuch as when the soul lacks union with the Beloved, it abides forever blind and darkened by itself.","If Thou showest not the way, our life is lost; A life living without Thee esteem as dead!","If Thou findest fault with Thy slaves, verily it is right in Thee, O Blessed One!","If Thou shouldst call sun and moon obscure, if Thou shouldst call the straight cypress crooked, if Thou shouldst declare the highest heaven base, or rich mines and oceans paupers, all this is the truth in relation to Thy perfection!","Thine is the dominion and the glory and the wealth!","For Thou art exempt from defect and not-being, thou givest existence to things non-existent, and again thou makest them non-existent.","Alas!","the forbidden fruits were eaten, and thereby the warm life of reason was congealed.","A grain of wheat eclipsed the sun Of Adam, like as the Dragons tail dulls the brightness of the moon.","Behold how delicate is the heart, that a morsel of dust clouded its moon with foul obscurity!","When bread is substance, to eat it nourishes us; When tis empty form, it profits nothing.","Like as the green thorn which is cropped by the camel, and then yields him pleasure and nutriment; When its greenness has gone and it becomes dry, if the camel crops that same thorn in the desert, it wounds his palate and mouth without pity, as if conserve of roses should turn to sharp swords.","When bread is substance, it is as a green thorn; When tis form, tis as the dry and coarse thorn.","And thou eatest it in the same way as of yore thou wert wont to eat it, O helpless being, eatest this dry thing in the same manner, after the real substance is mingled with dust; It has become mingled with dust, dry in pith and rind.","O camel, now beware of that herb!","The Word is become foul with mingled earth; The water is become muddy; close the mouth of the well, till God makes it again pure and sweet; Yea, till He purifies what He has made foul.","Patience will accomplish thy desire, not haste.","Be patient, God knows what is best.","THE Composition of this Masnavi has been delayed for a season; Time is needed for blood to become milk.","Till thy fortune comes forth as a new-born babe, blood becomes not milk, sweet and pleasant to the mind.","When that light of God, Husamu-d-Din turned his course down from the summit of heaven, while he had ascended to sublimest verities, in the absence of his spring the buds blossomed not, but when out of that sea he came to shore, the lute of the poesy of the Masnavi sounded again.","This Masnavi, which is the polisher of spirits, its recommencement occurred on the day of Opening.","The commencement date of this precious work was the year six hundred and sixty-two of the Flight.","The Bulbul started on this date and became a hawk; Yea, a hawk to hunt out these mysteries.","May the wrist of the King be the resting-place of this hawk, and may this door be open to the people for ever!","Why the poet veils his doctrines in fables.","What is it hinders me from expounding my doctrines but this, that my hearers hearts incline elsewhere.","Their thoughts are intent on that Sufi guest; They are immersed in his affairs neck deep.","So I am compelled to turn from my discourse to that story, and to set forth his condition.","But, O friend, think not this Sufi a mere outward form, as children see in a vine nothing but raisins.","O son, our bodies are as dried grapes and raisins; If you are a man, cast away these things.","If you pass on to the pure mysteries of God, you will be exalted above the nine heavenly spheres.","Now hear the outward form of my story, but yet separate the grain from the chaff.","Why the prophets were sent.","God sent the prophets for this purpose, namely, to sever infidelity from faith.","God sent the prophets to mankind that they might gather the pure grain on their tray.","Infidel and faithful, Mosalman and Jew, before the prophets came, seemed all as one.","Before they came we were all alike, no one knew whether he was right or wrong.","Genuine coin and base coin were current alike; The world was a night, and we travelers in the dark, till the sun of the prophets arose, and cried, Begone.","O slumber; welcome, O pure light!","Now the eye sees how to distinguish colors, it sees the difference between rubies and pebbles.","The eye distinguishes jewels from dust, hence it is dust makes the eyes smart.","Makers of base coin hate the daylight, coins of pure gold love the daylight, because daylight is the mirror that reflects them, so that they see their own perfect beauty.","God has named the resurrection that day; Day shows off the beauty of red and yellow.","Wherefore Day in truth is the mystery of the saints; One day of their moons is as whole years.","Know, Day  is the reflection of the mystery of the saints, eye-closing night that of their hidden secrets.","Therefore hath God revealed the chapter Daylight, Which daylight is the light of the heart of Mustafa.","On the other view, that daylight means The Friend, It is also a reflection of the same prophet.","For, as it is wrong to swear by a transitory being, how can we suppose a transitory being spoken of by God?","The Friend of God said, I love not them that set?","How, then, could Allah have meant a transitory being?","Again, the words by the night mean Muhammads veiling, namely, the fair earthly body that he bore; When his sun proceeded from heaven on high into that bodys night, it said, He hath not forsaken thee; Union with God arose out of the depth of that disgrace; That boon was the word, He hath not been displeased.","Expressions of religious or other feeling derive their only value from the state of mind from which they proceed.","Every expression is the sign of a state of mind; That state is a hand, the expression an instrument.","A goldsmiths instruments in the hand of a cobbler are as grains of wheat sown on sand.","The tools of a cobbler in the hand of a cultivator are as grass before a dog or bones before an ass.","The words, I am the Truth were light in Mansurs mouth, in the mouth of Pharaoh I am Lord Supreme was blasphemy.","The staff in the hand of Moses was a witness, in the hands of the magicians it was naught.","For this cause Isa taught not to that foolish man the words of power whereby he raised the dead.","For he who is ignorant misuses the instrument ; If you strike flint on mud you will get no fire.","Hand and instrument resemble flint and steel; You must have a pair; a pair is needed to generate.","He who has no peer or member is the One, An uneven number, One without dispute!","Whoso says one and two, and so on, confesses thereby the existence of the One.","When the illusion of seeing double is swept away, they who say one and two are even as they who say One.","If you take One as your ball in his tennis-field, it is made to revolve by the strokes of his bat.","Yea, the ball that is even and without fault is made to revolve by the strokes of the Kings hand.","O man of double vision, 5 hearken with attention, seek a cure for your defective sight by listening.","Many are the holy words that find no entrance into blind hearts, but they enter hearts full of light.","But the deceits of Satan enter crooked hearts, even as crooked shoes fit crooked feet.","Though you repeat pious expressions again and again, if you are a fool, they affect you not at all; Nay, not though you set them down in writing, and though you proclaim them vauntingly; Wisdom averts its face from you, O man of sin, wisdom breaks away from you and takes to flight!","On Taqlid, blind imitation or cant.","O wretch, why did you not come and say to me, Such and such a disastrous affair has occurred?","The servant replied, By Allah, I came again and again, that I might acquaint you with the matter.","You were always saying, The ass is gone, my lad!","Along with the others in high excitement; So I went away, thinking you knew all about it, and were pleased at the transaction, being a wise man.","The Sufi said, They were all singing the same words, so I felt impelled to sing them as well.","Blind imitation of them has undone me.","Cursed be that blind imitation!","The effect of blindly imitating unprofitable conduct is that men cast away honor for a morsel of bread.","The ecstasy of that company cast a reflection, whereby that Sufis heart became ecstatic like them.","You need many reflections from your associates in order to draw water from the peerless Ocean.","The first reflection cast is mere blind imitation; After it has been often repeated you may test its truth.","Till it is thus verified, take it not from your friends; The drop, not yet become pearl, sever not from its shell.","Evil influence of covetousness.","Would you have eyes and ears of reason clear, tear off the obstructing veil of greed!","The blind imitation of that Sufi proceeded from greed; Greed closed his mind to the pure light.","Yea, twas greed that led astray that Sufi, and brought him to loss of property and ruin.","Greed of victuals, greed of that ecstatic singing hindered his wits from grasping the truth.","If greed stained the face of a mirror, that mirror would be as deceitful as we men are.","If a pair of scales were greedy of riches, would they tell truly the weight of anything?","The Prophet saith, O people, through singleness of mind, i ask of you no recompense for my prophesying; I am a guide; God buyeth my guidance for you, god giveth you my guidance in both worlds.","True, a guide deserves his wages; Wages are due to him for directing you aright.","But what are my wages?","The vision of The Friend.","Abu Bakr indeed offered me forty thousand pieces of gold, but his forty thousand pieces were no wages for me.","How could I take brass beads for pearls of Aden?","I will tell you a tale; hearken attentively, that you may know how greed closes up the ears.","Every man subject to greed is a miser.","Can eyes of hearts clouded with greed see clearly?","The illusion of rank and riches blinds his sight, like hair dropping down before his eyes.","The pauper said, Your beneficence is my sustenance; To me, as to aliens, your prison is a paradise.","If you banish me from your prison in reprobation, i must needs die of poverty and affliction.","Just so Iblis said to Allah, O have compassion; Lord!","respite me till the day of resurrection; For in this prison of the world I am at oase, that I may slay the children of my enemies.","From every one who has true faith for food, and as bread for his provisions by the way, i take it away by fraud or deceit, so that they raise bitter cries of regret.","Sometimes I menace them with poverty, sometimes I blind their eyes with tresses and moles.","In this prison the food of true faith is scarce, and by the tricks of this dog what there is is lost.","In spite of prayers and fasts and endless pains, our food is altogether devoured by him.","Let us seek refuge with Allah from Satan.","Alas","we are perishing by his insolence.","The dog is one, yet he enters a thousand forms; Whatever he enters straight becomes himself.","Whatever makes you shiver, know he is in it, the Devil is hidden beneath its outward form.","When he finds no form at hand, he enters your thoughts, to cause them to draw you into sin.","From your thoughts proceeds destruction, when from time to time evil thoughts occur to you.","Sometimes thoughts of pleasure, sometimes of business, sometimes thoughts of science, sometimes of house and home.","Sometimes thoughts of gain and traffic, sometimes thoughts of merchandise and wealth.","Sometimes thoughts of money and wives and children, sometimes thoughts of wisdom or of sadness.","Sometimes thoughts of household goods and fine linen, sometimes thoughts of carpets, sometimes of sweepers.","Sometimes thoughts of mills, gardens, and villas, sometimes of clouds and mists and jokes and jests.","Sometimes thoughts of peace and war, sometimes thoughts of honor and disgrace.","Ah!","cast out of your head these vain imaginations, ah!","sweep out of your heart these evil suggestions.","Cry, There is no power nor strength but in God!","To avert the Evil One from the world and your own soul.","It is the true Beloved who causes all outward earthly beauty to exist.","Whatsoever is perceived by sense He annuls, but He establishes that which is hidden from the senses.","The lovers love is visible, his Beloved hidden.","The Friend is absent, the distraction he causes present.","Renounce these affections for outward forms, love depends not on outward form or face.","Whatever is beloved is not a mere empty form, whether your beloved be of the earth or of heaven.","Whatever be the form you have fallen in love with, why do you forsake it the moment life leaves it?","The form is still there; whence, then, this disgust at it?","Ah!","lover, consider well what is really your beloved.","If a thing perceived by outward senses is the beloved, then all who retain their senses must still love it; And since love increases constancy, how can constancy fail while form abides?","But the truth is, the suns beams strike the wall, and the wall only reflects that borrowed light.","Why give your heart to mere stones, O simpleton?","Go!","seek the source of light which shineth always!","Distinguish well true dawn from false dawn, distinguish the color of the wine from that of the cup; So that, instead of many eyes of caprice, one eye may be opened through patience and constancy.","Then you will behold true colors instead of false, and precious jewels in lieu of stones.","But what is a jewel?","Nay, you will be an ocean of pearls; Yea, a sun that measures the heavens!","The real Workman is hidden in His workshop, go you into that workshop and see Him face to face.","Inasmuch as over that Workman His work spreads a curtain, you cannot see Him outside His work.","Since His workshop is the abode of the Wise One, whoso seeks Him without is ignorant of Him.","Come, then, into His workshop, which is Not-being, that you may see the Creator and creation at once.","Whoso has seen how bright is the workshop sees how obscure is the outside of that shop.","Rebellious Pharaoh set his face towards Being (egoism), and was perforce blind to that workshop.","Perforce he looked for the Divine decree to change, and hoped to turn his destiny from his door.","While destiny at the impotence of that crafty one all the while was secretly mocking.","He slew a hundred thousand guiltless babes that the ordinance and decree of Allah might be thwarted.","That the prophet Moses might not be born alive, he committed a thousand murders in the land.","He did all this, yet Moses was born, and was protected against his wrath.","Had he but seen the Eternal workshop, he had refrained hand and foot from these vain devices.","Within his house was Moses safe and sound, while he was killing the babes outside to no purpose.","Just so the slave of lusts who pampers his body fancies that some other man bears him ill-will; Saying this one is my enemy, and this one my foe, while it is his own body which is his enemy and foe, he is like Pharaoh, and his body is like Moses, he runs abroad crying, where is my foe?","While lust is in his house, which is his body, he bites his finger in spite against strangers.","Then follows an anecdote of a man who slew his mother because she was always misconducting herself with strangers, and who excused himself by pleading that if he had not done so he would have been obliged to slay strangers every day, and thus incur blood-guiltiness.","Lust is likened to this abandoned mother; when it is once slain, you are at peace with all men.","In answer to an objection that if this were so the prophets and saints, who have subdued lust, would not have been hated and oppressed as they were, it is pointed out that they who hated the prophets in reality hated themselves, just as sick men quarrel with the physician or boys with the teacher.","Prophets and saints are created to test the dispositions of men, that the good may be severed from the bad.","The numerous grades of prophets, of saints, and of holy men are ordained, as so many curtains of the light of God, to tone down its brilliance, and make it visible to all grades of human sight.","With that brightness of lightning He kindled their souls so that Adam acquired knowledge from that light.","That, which shone from Adam was gathered by Seth, wherefore Adam made him his viceroy when he saw it.","When Noah received the gift of that lustre, he became a soul bearing pearls in the tempest of the flood.","By that light the soul of Abraham was led, without fear he entered Nimrods fiery furnace.","When Ishmael sought out that light, he meekly laid his head beneath his fathers bright knife.","The soul of David was warmed by its heat, iron became pliable by the force of his weaving.","When Solomon was nurtured by its fruition, the devils became the submissive slaves of his will.","When Jacob bowed his head to the Divine decree, he recovered his sight at the scent of his son.","When moonlike Joseph saw that brilliant sun, he became so expert as he was in interpreting dreams.","When the staff drew might from the hand of Moses, it devoured the realm of Pharaoh at a mouthful.","When the soul of Jirjis became privy to its light, he sacrificed his life seven times, and regained it.","When Zakhariah boasted of his love for it, he ransomed his life in the hollow of the tree.","When Jonah swallowed a draught from that cup, he found repose in the belly of the fish.","When John the Baptist became filled with its unction, he laid his head in the golden charger in ardour for it.","When Jethro became aware of this exaltation, he risked his life to find it.","Patient Job gave thanks for seven years, for in his calamities he saw signs of its approach.","When Khizr and Elias boasted of gaining it, they found the water of life and were no more seen.","When Jesus.","Son of Mary, found that ladder of ascent, he ascended to the height of the fourth heaven.","When Muhammad gained that blessed possession, in a moment he cleft asunder the disk of the moon.","When Abu Bakr became the exemplar of that grace, he was companion of that Lord, and a c faithful witness.","When Omar was enraptured with that beauty, like a mind he discerned true and false.","When Osman viewed those brilliant sights, he diffused light and became Lord of the two lights.","When Martaza (Ali) shined with its reflection, he became the Lion of God in the souls domain.","When his two sons were illumined by this light, they became the pearly earrings of highest heaven; One of them losing his life by poison, the other losing his head as he went about his march.","When Junaid was succoured by the forces of that light, his ecstatic states exceeded counting.","Bayazid saw his way to increased fruition thereof, and gained from God the name Polestar of Gnostics.","What time King Mansur became victorious, he left his throne and hastened to the stake.","When Karkhi of Karkh became its keeper, he became lord of love and of the breath of Jesus.","Ibrahim son of Adham rode his horse to that point, and became king of kings of equity.","And that Shakik starting from that junction became a sun of wit and acute of genius.","Fazil from a highway robber became a sage of the way, when he was regarded with esteem by the King.","To Bishr Hafi the doctrine, was announced, and he set his face towards the desert of inquiry.","When Zu-I-Ntin became distraught with care for it, egypt (Milk) as sugar became the house of his soul.","When Sari lost his head in seeking the way thereto, his rank was exalted above the seats of the mighty.","A hundred thousand great (spiritual) kings exalted by this divine light approach the world.","Their names remain hidden through Gods jealousy; Every beggar tells not their names.","That my outward form may not mislead you, digest my sweet advice before copying me.","Many are they who have been captured by form, who aimed at form, and found Allah.","After all, soul is linked to body, though it in nowise resembles the body.","The power of the light of the eye is mated with fat, the light of the heart is hidden in a drop of blood.","Joy harbors in the kidneys and pain in the liver, the lamp of reason in the brains of the head; Smell in the nostrils and speech in the tongue, concupiscence in the flesh and courage in the heart.","These connections are not without a why and a how, but reason is at a loss to understand the how.","Universal Soul had connection with Partial Soul, which thence conceived a pearl and retained it in its bosom.","From that connection, like Mary, soul became pregnant of a fair Messiah; Not that Messiah who walked upon earth and water, but that Messiah who is higher than space.","Next, as Soul became pregnant by the Soul of souls, so by the former Soul did the world become pregnant; Then the World brought forth another world, and of this last are brought forth other worlds.","Should I reckon them in my speech till the last day i should fail to tell the total of these resurrections.","It was not ye who shot, but God shot; and those arrows were Gods not yours.","Tis Gods light that illumines the senses light, that is the meaning of Light upon light.","The senses light draws us earthwards, gods light carries us heavenwards.","As objects of sense are of base condition, gods light is an ocean, and the senses light a dewdrop.","But that light which is upon this light is not seen, save through signs and holy discourses.","Since the senses light is gross and dense, it lies hidden in the black pupil of the eye.","When you cannot see the senses light with the eye, how can you see with the eye the Light of the mind?","As the senses light is hidden in these gross veils, must not that Light which is pure be also hidden?","Like the senses, this world is ruled by a hidden Power.","It confesses its impotence before that hidden Power, which sometimes exalts it and sometimes lays it low, sometimes makes it dry and sometimes moist.","The hand is hidden, yet we see the pen writing; The horse is galloping, yet the rider is hid from view.","The arrow speeds forth, yet the bow is not seen; Souls are seen, the Soul of souls (God) is hidden.","Break not the arrow, for it is the arrow of the King yea, it is an arrow from the bow of Wisdom.","Ye shot not when ye shot, was said by God; Gods action has predominance over all actions.","Break your own passion, break not that arrow, the eye of passion takes milk to be blood.","Kiss that arrow and bear it to the King, yea, though it be stained with your own blood.","Whatsoever is seen is weak and base and impotent; What is hidden is equally fierce and headstrong.","We are the captured game; who is the snare?","We are the balls; where is the bat?","He tears and mends; who is this tailor?","He fans and kindles the flame; who is this kindler?","At one time He makes the faithful one an infidel, at another He makes the atheist a devotee!","Next comes an anecdote of a dirty man who refused to bathe because he was ashamed to go into the water, with the moral that Shame hinders religion; and then another of zul Nun, a celebrated Egyptian Sufi of the third century a.H.","Zul Nun appeared to his ignorant friends to be mad, and they accordingly confined him in a madhouse.","After a time they thought that he was not really mad, but had feigned madness for some deep purpose, and they went to the madhouse to inquire into the state of his health.","When they arrived there, Zul Nun asked them who they were, and they answered that they were his devoted friends, who were now convinced that the story of his being mad was a calumny.","Zul nun jumped up and drove them away with sticks and stones, saying that true friendship would have been manifested in sharing his troubles, even as pure gold is tried by fire.","Through love bitter things seem sweet, through love bits of copper are made gold.","Through love dregs taste like pure wine, through love pains are as healing balms.","Through love thorns become roses, and through love vinegar becomes sweet wine.","Through love the stake becomes a throne, through love reverse of fortune seems good fortune.","Through love a prison seems a rose bower, without love a grate full of ashes seems a garden.","Through love burning fire is pleasing light, through love the Devil becomes a Houri.","Through love hard stones become soft as butter, without love soft wax becomes hard iron.","Through love grief is as joy, through love Ghouls turn into angels.","Through love stings are as honey, through love lions are harmless as mice.","Through love sickness is health, through love wrath is as mercy.","Through love the dead rise to life, through love the king becomes a slave.","Even when an evil befalls you, have due regard; Regard well him who does you this ill turn.","The sight which regards the ebb and flow of good and ill opens a passage for you from misfortune to happiness.","Thence you see the one state moves you into the other, one opposite state generating its opposite in exchange.","So long as you experience not fears after joys, how can you look for pleasures after disgusts?","While ye fear the doom of the angel on the left hand, men hope for the bliss of the angel on the right.","May you gain two wings!","A fowl with only one wing is impotent to fly, O well-intentioned one!","Now either permit me to hold my peace altogether, or give me leave to explain the whole matter.","And if you dislike this and forbid that, who can tell what your desire is?","You must have the soul of Abraham in order with light to see the mansions of Paradise in the fire.","Step by step he ascended above sun and moon, and so lagged not below, as a ring that fastens a door.","Since the Friend of God ascended above the heavens, and said, I love not Gods that set; So this world of the body is a breeder of misconceptions in all who have not fled from lust.","A voice came from God to Moses, Why hast thou sent my servant away?","Thou hast come to draw men to union with me, not to drive them far away from me.","So far as possible, engage not in dissevering; The thing most repugnant to me is divorce.","To each person have I allotted peculiar forms, to each have I given particular usages.","What is praiseworthy in thee is blameable in him, what is poison for thee is honey for him.","What is good in him is bad in thee, what is fair in him is repulsive in thee.","I am exempt from all purity and impurity, i need not the laziness or alacrity of my people.","I created not men to gain a profit from them, but to shower my beneficence upon them.","In the men of Hind the usages of Hind are praiseworthy, in the men of Sind those of Sind.","I am not purified by their praises, Tis they who become pure and shining thereby.","I regard not the outside and the words, i regard the inside and the state of heart.","I look at the heart if it be humble, though the words may be the reverse of humble.","Because the heart is substance, and words accidents, accidents are only a means, substance is the final cause.","How long wilt thou dwell on words and superficialities?","A burning heart is what I want; consort with burning!","Kindle in thy heart the flame of love, and burn up utterly thoughts and fine expressions.","O Moses!","the lovers of fair rites are one class, they whose hearts and souls burn with love are another.","Lovers must burn every moment, as tax and tithe are levied on a ruined village.","If they speak amiss, call them not sinners; If a martyr be stained with blood, wash it not away.","Blood is better than water for martyrs, this fault is better than a thousand correct forms.","No need to turn to the Kaba when one is in it, and divers have no need of shoes.","One does not take a drunken man as a guide on the way, nor speak of darns to forn garments.","The sect of lovers is distinct from all others, lovers have a religion and a faith of their own.","Though the ruby has no stamp, what matters it?","Love is fearless in the midst of the sea of fear.","Beware, if thou offerest praises or thanksgivings, and know them to be even as the babble of that shepherd; Though thy praises be better compared with his, yet in regard to God they are full of defects.","How long wilt thou say, They obscure the truth, for it is not such as they fancy?","Thy own prayers are accepted only through mercy, they are suffered as the prayers of an impure woman.","If her prayers are made impure by the flow of blood, thine are stained with metaphors and similitudes.","Blood is impure, yet its stain is removed by water; But that impurity of ignorance is more lasting, seeing that without the blessed water of God it is not banished from the man who is subject to it.","O that thou wouldst turn thy face to thy own prayers, and become cognizant of the meaning of thy ejaculations, and say, Ah!","my prayers are as defective as my being; requite me good for evil!","Moses questions God as to the reason of the flourishing state of the wicked.","Moses said, O beneficent Creator, with whom a moments remembrance is as long ages, i see Thy plan distorted in this world of earth and water; My heart, like the angels, feels a difficulty thereat.","With what object hast thou framed this plan, and sowed therein the seeds of evil?","Why hast Thou kindled the fire of violence and wrong?","Why burnt up mosques and them who worship therein?","Paradise is attached to requirements unpleasant to us, hell is attached to things flattering our lusts.","The branch full of sap is the main fuel of thy fire.","They that are burnt with fire are near to Kausar.","Whoso is in prison and acquainted with troubles, that is in requital for his gluttony and lusts.","Whoso is in a palace and enjoying wealth, that is in reward for toils and troubles.","Whoso is seen enjoying uncounted gold and silver, know that he strove patiently to acquire it.","He, whose soul is exempt from natural conditions, and who possesses the power of overriding causes, can see without causes, like eyes that pierce night; But thou, who art dependent on sense attend to causes.","Having left Jesus, thou cherishest an ass (lust), and art perforce excluded, like an ass; The portion of Jesus is knowledge and wisdom, not so the portion of an ass, O asinine one!","Thou pitiest thine ass when it complains; So art thou ignorant, thy ass makes thee asinine.","Keep thy pity for Jesus, not for the ass, make not thy lust to vanquish thy reason.","Leave thy natural lusts to whine and howl, tear thee from them, escape that snare of the soul!","He who needs mercy finds it.","Doing kindness is the game and quarry of good men, a good man seeks in the world only pains to cure.","Wherever there is a pain there goes the remedy, wherever there is poverty there goes relief.","Seek not water, only show you are thirsty, that water may spring up all around you.","That you may hear the words, The Lord gives them to drink, Be athirst!","Allah knows what is best for you.","Seek you the water of mercy?","Be downcast, and straightway drink the wine of mercy to intoxication.","Mercy is called down by mercy to the last.","Withhold not, then, mercy from any one, O son!","If of yourself you cannot journey to the Kaba, represent your helplessness to the Reliever.","Cries and groans are a powerful means, and the All-Merciful is a mighty nurse.","The nurse and the mother keep excusing themselves, till their child begins to cry.","In you too has God created infant needs; When they cry out, their milk is brought to them; God said, Call on God; continue crying, so that the milk of His love may boil up.","Moses and the worshipper of the calf.","Moses said to one of those full of vain imaginations, O malevolent one, through error and heresy you entertain a hundred doubts as to my prophethood, notwithstanding these proofs, and my holy character.","You have seen thousands of miracles done by me, yet they only multiply your doubts and cavils.","Through doubts and evil thoughts you are in a strait, you speak despitefully of my prophethood.","I brought the host out of the Red Sea before all men, that ye might escape the oppression of the Egyptians.","For forty years meat and drink came from heaven, and water sprang from the rock at my prayer.","My staff became a mighty serpent in my hand, water became blood for my ill-conditioned enemy.","The staff became a snake, and my hand bright as the sun; From the reflection of that light the sun became a star.","Have not these incidents, and hundreds more like them, banished these doubts from you, O cold-hearted one?","The calf lowed through magic, and you bowed down to it, saying, Thou art my God.","The golden calf lowed; but what did it say, that the fools should feel all this devotion to it?","You have seen many more wondrous works done by me, but where is the base man who accepts the truth?","What is it that charms vain men but vanity?","What else pleases the foolish but folly?","Because each kind is charmed by its own kind, does a cow ever seek the lion?","Did the wolf show love to Joseph, or only fraud upon fraud with a view to devour him?","True, if it lose his wolf-like nature it becomes a friend; Even as the dog of the cave became a son of man.","When good Abu Bakr saw Muhammad, he recognized his truth, saying, This one is true; When Abu Bakr caught the perfume of Muhammad, he said, This is no false one.","But Abu Jahl, who was not one of the sympathizers, saw the moon split asunder, yet believed not.","If from a sympathizer, to whom it is well known, i withhold the truth, still tis not hidden from him;

See them tied up tightly in the corner of my cloak.","The Sage said, Circumambulate me seven times; Count this better than circumambulating the Kaba; And as for the dirhams, give them to me, O liberal one, and know you have finished your course and obtained your wish, you have made the pilgrimage and gained the life to come, you have become pure, and that in a moment of time.","Of a truth that is God which your soul sees in me, for God has chosen me to be His house.","Though the Kaba is the house of His grace and favors, yet my body too is the house of His secret.","Since He made that house He has never entered it, but none but That Living One enters this house; When you have seen me you have seen God, and have circumambulated the veritable Kaba.","To serve me is to worship and praise God; Think not that God is distinct from me.","Open clear eyes and look upon me, that you may behold the light of God in a mortal.","Tho Beloved once called the Kaba My house, But has said to me O my servant seventy times; O Bayazid, you have found the Kaba, you have found a hundred precious blessings.","Bayazid gave heed to these deep sayings, and placed them as golden earrings in his ears.","Then follow anecdotes of the Prophet paying a visit to one of his disciples who lay sick, of Shaikh Bahlol, nicknamed The Madman, who was a favorite at the court of harunu-r-Rashid, and of the people of Moses.","The sweet uses of adversity.","The sick man said, Sickness has brought me this boon.","That this Prince (Muhammad) has come to me this morn, so that health and strength may return to me from the visit of this unparalleled King.","O blessed pain and sickness and fever!","O welcome weariness and sleeplessness by night!","Lo!","God of His bounty and favor has sent me this pain and sickness in my old age; He has given me pain in the back, that I may not fail to spring up out of my sleep at midnight; That I may not sleep all night like the cattle, god in His mercy has sent me these pains.","At my broken state the pity of kings has boiled up, and hell is put to silence by their threats!","Pain is a treasure, for it contains mercies; The kernel is soft when the rind is scraped off.","O brother, the place of darkness and cold is the fountain of life and the cup of ecstasy.","So also is endurance of pain and sickness and disease.","For from abasement proceeds exaltation.","The spring seasons are hidden in the autumns, and autumns are charged with springs; flee them not.","Consort with grief and put up with sadness, seek long life in your own death!","Since tis bad, whatever lust says on this matter heed it not, its business is opposition.","But act contrary thereto, for the prophets have laid this injunction upon the world.","Though it is right to take counsel in affairs, that you may have less to regret in the upshot; The prophets have labored much to make the world revolve on this pivot stone; But, in order to destroy the people, lust desires to make them go astray and lose their heads; The people say, With whom shall we take counsel?","The prophets answer, With the reason of your chief again they say, Suppose a child or a woman enter, who lacks reason and clear judgment;  They reply, Take counsel with them, and act contrary to what they advise.","Know your lust to be woman, and worse than woman; Woman is partial evil, lust universal evil.","If you take counsel with your lust, see you act contrary to what that base one advises.","Even though it enjoin prayers and fasting, it is treacherously laying a snare for you.","You must abandon and ignore your own knowledge, and dip your hand in the dish of abnegation of knowledge.","Whatever seems profitable, flee from it, drink poison and spill the water of life.","Contemn whatever praises you, lend to paupers your wealth and profits!","Quit your sect and be a subject of aversion, cast away name and fame and seek disgrace!","God the Author of good and evil.","If you seek the explanation of Gods love and favor, in connection therewith read the chapter Brightness.","And if you say evil also proceeds from Him, yet what damage is that to His perfection?","To send that evil is one of His perfections.","I will give you an illustration, O arrogant one; The heavenly Artist paints His pictures of two sorts, fair pictures and pictures the reverse of fair.","Joseph he painted fair and made him beautiful; He also painted ugly pictures of demons and afrits.","Both sorts of pictures are of His workmanship, they proceed not from His imperfection, but His skill, that the perfection of His wisdom may be shown, and the gainsayers of His art be put to shame.","Could He not paint ugly things He would lack art, and therefore He creates Guebers as well as Moslems.","Thus, both infidelity and faith bear witness to Him, both alike bow down before His almighty sway.","But know, the faithful worship Him willingly, for they seek and aim at pleasing Him; While Guebers worship Him unwillingly, their real aim and purpose being quite otherwise.","Evil itself is turned into good for the good.","The Prophet said to that sick man, Pray in this wise and allay your difficulties; Give us good in the house of our present world, and give us good in the house of our next world.","Make our path pleasant as a garden, and be Thou, O Holy One, our goal!","The faithful will say on the last day, O King!","Was not Hell on the route all of us traveled?","Did not faithful as well as infidels pass through it?","Yet on our way we perceived not the smoke of the fire; Nay, it seemed Paradise and the mansion of the blessed.","Then the King will answer, That green garden, as it appeared to you on your passage through it, was indeed Hell and the place of dread forment; Yet for you it became a garden green with trees.","Since you have labored to make hellish lusts, and the fire of pride that courts destruction, to make these, I say, pure and clean, and, to please God, have quenched those fires, so that the fire of lust, that erst breathed flame, has become a holy garden and a guiding light, since you have turned the fire of wrath to meekness, and the darkness of ignorance to shining knowledge, since you have turned the fire of greed into bounty, and the vile thorns of malice into a rose-garden; Since you have quenched all these fires of your own for my sake, so that those poisons are now pure sweets; Since you have made fiery lust as a verdant garden, and have sowed therein the seed of fidelity, so that nightingales of prayer and praise ever warble sweetly around this garden; Since you have responded to the call of God, and have drawn water out of the hell of lust, for this cause my hell also, for your behoof, becomes a verdant garden and yields leaves and fruit.","What is the recompense of well-doing, O son?","It is kindness and good treatment and rich requital.","Have ye not said, We are victims, mere nothings before eternal Being?","If we are drunkards or madmen, Tis that Cup-bearer and that Cup which make us so.","We bow down our heads before His edict and ordinance, we stake precious life to gain His favor.","While the thought of the Beloved fills our hearts, all our work is to do Him service and spend life for Him.","Wherever He kindles His destructive forch, myriads of lovers souls are burnt therewith.","The lovers who dwell within the sanctuary are moths burnt with the forch of the Beloveds face.","O heart haste thither, for God will shine upon you, and seem to you a sweet garden instead of a terror.","He will infuse into your soul a new soul, so as to fill you, like a goblet, with wine.","Take up your abode in His soul!","Take up your abode in heaven, O bright full moon!","Like the heavenly Scribe, He will open your hearts book that He may reveal mysteries unto you.","Abide with your Friend, since you have gone astray, strive to be a full moon; you are now a fragment thereof.","Wherefore this shrinking of the part from its whole?","Why this association with its foes?","Behold Genus become Species in due course, behold secrets become manifest through his light!","So long as woman-like you swallow blandishments, how, O wise man, can you get relief from false flatteries?","These flatteries and fair words and deceits (of lust) You take, and swallow, just like women.","But the reproaches and the blows of Darveshes are really better for you than the praises of sinners.","Take the light blows of Darveshes, not the honey of sinners, and become, by the fortune of good, good yourself.","Because from them the robe of good fortune is gained, in the asylum of the spirit blood becomes life.","A certain man was going into the mosque, just as another was coming out.","He inquired of him what had occurred to the meeting, that the people were coming out of the mosque so soon.","The other told him that the Prophet had concluded the public prayers and mysteries.","Whither go you, said he, O foolish one, seeing the Prophet has already given the blessing?","The first heaved a sigh, and its smoke ascended; That sigh yielded a perfume of his hearts blood.","The other, who came from the mosque, said to him, Give me that sigh, and take my prayers instead.","The first said, I give it, and take your prayers.","The other took that sigh with a hundred thanks.","He went his way with deep humility and contrition, as a hawk who had ascended in the track of the falcon.","That night, as ho lay asleep, he heard a voice from heaven, Thou hast bought the water of life and healing; The worth of what thou hast chosen and possessed equals that of all the peoples accepted prayers.","My people adopt my law without obeying it, they take that coin without assaying it.","The Korans wisdom is like the believers lost camel, Every one is certain his camel is lost.","You have lost your camel and seek it diligently; Yet how will you find it if you know not your own?","What was lost?","Was it a female camel that you lost?","It escaped from your hand, and you are in a maze.","The caravan is come to be loaded, your camel is vanished from the midst of it.","You run here and there, your mouth parched with heat; The caravan moves on, and night approaches.","Your goods lie on the ground in a dangerous road, you hurry after your camel in all directions.","You cry O Moslems, who has seen a camel, which escaped from its stable this morning?","To him who shall give me news of my camel i will give a reward of so many dirhems.","You go on seeking news of your camel from every one, and every lewd fellow flatters you with a fresh rumor, saying, I saw a camel; it went this way; Twas red, and it went towards this pasture.","Another says, Its ear was cropped.","Another says, Its cloth was embroidered.","Another that it had only one eye, another that it had lost its hair from mange.","To gain the reward every base fellow mentions a hundred marks without any foundation.","All false doctrines contain an element of truth.","Just so every one in matters of doctrine gives a different description of the hidden subject.","A philosopher expounds it in one way, and a critic at once refutes his propositions.","A third censures both of them; A fourth spends his life in traducing the others.","Every one mentions indications of this road, in order to create an impression that he has gone it.","This truth and that truth cannot be all true, and yet all of them are not entirely astray in error.","Because error occurs not without some truth, fools buy base coins from their likeness to real coins.","If there were no genuine coins current in the world, how could coiners succeed in passing false coins?","If there were no truth, how could falsehood exist?","Falsehood derives its plausibility from truth.","Tls the desire of right that makes men buy wrong; Let poison be mixed with sugar, and they eat it at once.","If wheat were not valued as sweet and good for food, the cheat who shows wheat and sells barley would make no profit!","Say not, then, that all these creeds are false, the false ones ensnare hearts by the scent of truth.","Say not that they are all erroneous fancies, there is no fancy in the universe without some truth.","Truth is the night of power hidden amongst other nights, in order to try the spirit of every night.","Not every night is that of power, O youth, nor yet is every night quite void of power.","In the crowd of rag-wearers there is but one Faqir; Search well and find out that true one.","Tell the wary and discerning believer to distinguish the king from the beggar.","If there were no bad goods in the world, every fool might be a skilful merchant; For then the hard art of judging goods would be easy.","If there were no faults, one man could judge as well as another.","Again, if all were faulty, skill would be profitless.","If all wood were common, there would be no aloes.","He who accepts everything as true is a fool, but he who says all is false is a knave.","Principles always produce bad acts."," Fools laud and magnify the mosque, while they strive to oppress holy men of heart.","But the former is mere form, the latter spirit and truth.","The only true mosque is that in the hearts of saints.","The mosque that is built in the hearts of the saints is the place of worship of all, for God dwells there.","So long as the hearts of the saints are not afflicted, god never destroys the nation.","Our forefathers lifted their hands against the prophets; Seeing their bodies, they took them for ordinary men.","In you also abide the morals of those men of old; How can you avoid fearing that you will act like them?","The morals of those unthankful ones dwell in you, your urn will not always return unbroken from the well.","Seeing that all these bad symptoms are seen in you, and that you are one with those men, how can you escape?","That person said in the time of Shuaib (Jethro), God has seen many faults done by me; Yea, how many sins and faults of mine has He seen, nevertheless of His mercy He punishes me not.","God Almighty spake in the ear of Shuaib, addressing him with an inner voice in answer thereto, Why hast thou said I have sinned so much, and God of His mercy has not punished my sins?","Thou sayest the very reverse of the truth, O fool!","Wandering from the way and lost in the desert!","How many times do I smite thee, and thou knowest not?","Thou art bound in my chains from head to foot.","On thy heart is rust on rust collected, so thou art blind to mysteries.","Thy rust, layer on layer, O black kettle!","Makes the aspect of thy inner parts foul.","If that smoke touched a new kettle, it would show the smut, were it only as a grain of barley; For everything is made manifest by its opposite, in contrast with its whiteness that black shows foul.","But when the kettle is black, then afterwards who can see on it the impression of the smoke?","If the blacksmith be a negro, his face agrees in color with the smoke.","But if a man of Rum does blacksmiths work, his face becomes grimed by the smoke fumes; Then he quickly perceives the impression of his fault, so that he wails and cries O Allah!","When he is stubborn and follows his evil practices, he casts dust in the eyes of his discernment.","He recks not of repentance, and, moreover, that sin becomes dear to his heart, so that he becomes without faith, old shame for sin and calling on God quit him, rust five layers deep settles on his mirror, rust spots begin to gnaw his iron, the color in his jewel grows less and less.","When you write on white paper, what is written is read at a glance; But when you write on the face of a written page, it is not plain, reading it is deceptive; For that black is written on the top of other black, both the writings are illegible and senseless.","Or if, in the third place, you write on the page, and then blacken it like an infidels soul, then what remedy but the aid of the Remedier?","Despair is copper and sight its elixir.","Lay your despair before Him, that you may escape from pain without medicine.","When Shuaib spoke these aphorisms to him, from that breath of the soul roses bloomed in his heart, his soul heard the revelations of heaven; He said, If He has punished me, where is the sign of it?","Shuaib said, O Lord, he repels my arguments, he seeks for a sign of that punishment.","The Veiler of sins replied, I will tell him no secrets, save only one, in order to try him.","One sign that I punish him is this, that he observes obedience and fasting and prayer, and devotions and almsgiving, and so on, yet never feels the least expansion of soul.","He performs the devotions and acts enjoined by law, yet derives not an atom of relish from them.","Outward devotion is sweet to him, spirit is not sweet, nuts in plenty, but no kernel in any of them.","Relish is needed for devotions to bear fruit, kernels are needed that seeds may yield trees.","How can seeds without kernels become trees?","Form without soul (life) is only a dream.","The mean is relative.","He said, Though the path of the mean is wisdom, yet is this same mean also relative.","The water which is insufficient for a camel is like an ocean to a mouse.","Whoso has four loaves as his daily allowance, whether he eat two or three, he observes the mean.","But if he eat all four he transgresses the mean, a very slave to greed, and voracious as a duck.","Whoso has an appetite for ten loaves, know, though he eat six, he observes the mean.","If I have an appetite for fifty loaves, while you can manage only six, we are not on a par.","You are wearied with ten prostrations in prayer, whilst I can endure five hundred.","Such an one goes barefoot to the Kaba, whilst another faints with going to the mosque.","The ecstatic state which exalts the subject of it above law.","At times my state resembles a dream, my dreaming seems to them infidelity.","Know my eyes sleep, but my heart is awake; My body, though forpid, is instinct with energy.","The Prophet said, Mine eyes sleep, but my heart is awake with the Lord of mankind.","Your eyes are awake and your heart fast asleep, my eyes are closed, and my heart at the open door.","My heart has other five senses of its own; These senses of my heart view the two worlds.","Let not a weakling like you censure me, what, seems night to you is broad day to me; What seems a prison to you is a garden to me.","Busiest occupation is rest to me.","Your feet are in the mire, to me, mire is rose, what to you is funeral wailing is marriage drum to me.","While I seem on earth, abiding with you in the house, i ascend like Saturn to the seventh heaven.","Tis not I who companion with you, tis my shadow; My exaltation transcends your thoughts, because I have transcended thought, yea, I have sped beyond reach of thought.","I am lord of thought, not overlorded by thought, as the builder is lord of the building.","All creatures are enslaved to thought; For this cause are they sad at heart and sorrowful.","I send myself on an embassy to thought, and, at will, spring back again from thought.","I am as the bird of heaven and thought as the fly, how can the fly lend a helping hand to me?","Whoso has in him a spark of the light of Omnipotence, however much he eats, say Eat on; tis lawful to him.","To the spiritual man the inner voice is its own evidence, and needs no other proof.","If you are a true lover of my soul, this truth-fraught saying of mine is no vain pretence, Though I talk half the night I am superior to you; And again, Fear not the night; here am I, your kinsman.","These two assertions of mine will both seem true to you the moment you recognize the voice of your kinsman.","Superiority and kinsmanship are both mere assertions, yet both are recognized for truth by men of clear wit.","The nearness of the voice proves to such an one that the voice proceeds from a friend who is near.","The sweetness of the kinsmans voice, too, O beloved, proves the veracity of that kinsman.","But the uninspired fool who from ignorance cannot tell the voice of a stranger from a friends, to him the friends saying seems a vain pretension, his ignorance is the material cause of his disbelief.","To the wise, whose hearts are enlightened, the mere sound of that voice proves its truth.","When you say to a thirsty man, Come quickly; This is water in the cup, take and drink it, Does the thirsty man say, This is a vain pretension; Go, remove yourself from me, O vain pretender, or proceed to give proofs and evidence that this is generic water, and concrete water thereof?","Or when a mother cries to her sucking babe, Come, O son, I am thy mother, Does the babe answer, O mother, show a proof that I shall find comfort from taking thy milk?","In the hearts of every sect that has a taste of the truth the sight and the voice of prophets work miracles.","When the prophets raise their cry to the outward ear, the souls of each sect bow in devotion within; Because never in this world hath the souls ear heard from any man the like of that cry.","That poor man in that strange sweet voice recognizes the voice of God, Verily I am nigh.","The Shaikh laughed, and said to him, O friend, this is the tree of knowledge, O knowing one; Very high, very fine, very expansive, the very water of life from the circumfluent ocean.","Thou hast run after form, O ill-informed one, wherefore thou lackest the fruit of the tree of substance.","Sometimes it is named tree, sometimes sun, sometimes lake, and sometimes cloud.","Tis one, though it has thousands of manifestations; Its least manifestation is eternal life!","Though tis one, it has a thousand manifestations, the names that fit that one are countless.","That one is to thy personality a father, in regard to another person He may be a son.","In relation to another He may be wrath and vengeance, in relation to another, mercy and goodness.","He has thousands of names, yet is One, answering to all of His descriptions, yet indescribable.","Every one who seeks names, if he is a man of credulity, like thee, remains hopeless and frustrated of his aim.","Why cleavest thou to this mere name of tree, so that thou art utterly balked and disappointed?","Pass over names and look to qualities, so that qualities may lead thee to essence!","The differences of sects arise from His names; When they pierce to His essence they find His peace!","Although a domestic fowl may have taken thee, who art a duckling, under her wing and nurtured thee, thy mother was a duck of that ocean.","Thy nurse was earthy, and her wing dry land.","The longing for the ocean which fills thy heart, that natural longing of thy soul comes from thy mother.","Thy longing for dry land comes to thee from thy nurse; Quit thy nurse, for she will lead thee astray.","Leave thy nurse on the dry land and push on, enter the ocean of real Being, like the ducks!","Though thy nurse may frighten thee away from water, do thou fear not, but haste on into the ocean!","Thou art a duck, and flourishest on land and water, and dost not, like a domestic fowl, dig up the house.","Thou art a king of the sons of Adam honored by God, And settest foot alike on sea and land; For impress on thy mind, We have carried them by sea, Before the words, We have carried them by land.","The angels go not on dry land, and the animals know nothing of the sea; Thou in body art an animal, in thy soul an angel; Hence thou goest both upon earth and on heaven.","Hence to outward view He is a man like you, While to his sharp-seeing heart it hath been revealed.","His earthy form has fallen on earth, his spirit revolving above highest heaven.","O boy, we are all of us waterfowl, the sea knows full well our language.","Solomon is, as it were, that sea, and we as the birds; In Solomon we hold our course to eternity.","Along with Solomon plunge into the ocean, then, like David, the water will make us coats-of-mail.","That Solomon is present to every one, but negligence closes their eyes and bewitches them.","Hence, through ignorance, sloth, and folly, though he stands hard by us, we are shut off from him.","The noise of thunder makes the head of the thirsty ache; When he knows not that it unlocks the blessed showers, his eyes are fixed on the running stream, unwitting of the sweetness of the rain from heaven.","He urges the steed of his desire towards the caused, and perforce remains shut off from the Causer.","Whoso beholds the Causer face to face, how can he set his heart on things caused on earth?","O son, the pious are Gods children, absent or present He is informed of their state.","Deem Him not absent when they are endangered, for He is jealous for their lives.","He saith, These saints are my children, though remote and alone and away from their Lord.","For their trial they are orphans and wretched, yet in love I am ever holding communion with them.","Thou art backed by all my protection; My children are, as it were, parts of me.","Verily these Darveshes of mine are thousands on thousands, and yet no more than One; For if not, how did Moses with one magic staff turn the realm of Pharaoh upside down?","And if it were not so, how did Noah with one curse make East and West alike drowned in his flood?","Nor could one prayer of eloquent Lot have razed their strong city against their will, their mighty city, like to Paradise, became as a Tigris of black water; go, see its vestige!","Towards Syria is this vestige and memorial, thou seest it in passing on the way to Jerusalem.","Thousands of God-fearing prophets in every age hold divine chastisements in hand.","Should I tell of them my limits would be exceeded, and not hearts only but very hills would bleed.","Evil deeds give mens prayers an ill savour in Gods nostrils.","Thou art asleep, and the smell of that forbidden fruit ascends to the azure skies, ascends along with thy foul breath, till it overpowers heaven with stench; Stench of pride, stench of lust, stench of greed.","All these stink like onions when a man speaks.","Though thou swearest, saying, When have I eaten?","Have I not abstained from onions and garlic?","The very breath of that oath tells tales, as it strikes the nostrils of them that sit with thee.","So too prayers are made invalid by such stenches, that crooked heart is betrayed by its speech.","The answer to that prayer is, Be ye driven into hell, The staff of repulsion is the reward of all deceit.","But, if thy speech be crooked and thy meaning straight, thy crookedness of words will be accepted of God.","That faithful Bilal, when he called to prayer, would devoutly cry, Come hither, come hither!","At last men said, O Prophet, this call is not right, this is wrong; now, what is thy intention?","O Prophet, and O ambassador of the Almighty, provide another Muazzin of better talent.","Tis an error at the beginning of our divine worship to utter the words, Come to the asylum!","The wrath of the Prophet boiled up, and he said (Uttering one or two secrets from the fount of grace), O base ones, in Gods sight the Ho!","of Bilal is better than a hundred Come hithers and ejaculations.","Ah!","excite not a tumult, lest I tell forth openly your secret thoughts from first to last.","If ye keep not your breath sweet in prayer, go, desire a prayer from the Brethren of Purity!","For this cause spake God to Moses, at the time he was asking aid in prayer, O Moses!","desire protection of me with a mouth that thou hast not sinned withal.","Moses answered, I possess not such a mouth.","God said, Call upon me with another mouth!","Act so that all thy mouths by night and by day may be raising prayers.","When thou hast sinned with one mouth, with thy other mouth cry, O Allah!","Or else cleanse thy own mouth, and make thy spirit alert and quick.","Calling on God is pure, and when purity approaches, impurity arises and takes its departure.","Contraries flee away from contraries; When day dawns night takes flight.","When the pure name (of God) enters the mouth, neither does impurity nor that impure mouth remain!","The man whose calling O Allah was equivalent to Gods answering him, Here am I."," That person one night was crying, O Allah!","That his mouth might be sweetened thereby, and Satan said to him, Be quiet, O austere one!","How long wilt thou babble, O man of many words?","No answer comes to thee from nigh the throne, how long wilt thou cry Allah with harsh face?","That person was sad at heart and hung his head, and then beheld Khizr present before him in a vision, who said to him, Ah!","thou hast ceased to call on God, wherefore repentest thou of calling upon Him?","The man said, The answer Here am I came not, wherefore I fear that I am repulsed from the door.","Khizr replied to him, God has given me this command; Go to him and say, O much-tried one, did not I engage thee to do my service?","Did not I engage thee to call upon me?","That calling Allah of thine was my Here am I, And that pain and longing and ardour of thine my messenger; Thy struggles and strivings for assistance were my attractions, and originated thy prayer.","Thy fear and thy love are the cove,rt of my mercy, each O Lord!","of thine contains many Here am Fs.","The soul of fools is alien from this calling on God, because it is not their wont to cry, O Lord!","On their mouths and hearts are locks and bonds, that they may not cry to God in time of distress.","God gave Pharaoh abundance of riches and wealth, so that he boasted that he was Lord Supreme.","In the whole of his life he suffered no headache, so that he never cried to God, wretch that he was.","God granted him the absolute dominion of the world, but withheld from him pain and sorrow and cares; Because pain and sorrow and loads of cares are the lot of Gods friends in the world.","Pain is better than the dominion of the world, so that thou mayest call on God in secret.","The cries of those free from pain are dull and cold, the cries of the sorrowful come from the burning hearts.","The house of Isa was the banquet of men of heart, ho!","afflicted one, quit not this door!","From all sides the people ever thronged, many blind and lame, and halt and afflicted, to the door of the house of Isa at dawn, that with his breath he might heal their ailments.","As soon as he had finished his orisons, that holy one would come forth at the third hour; He viewed those impotent folk, troop by troop, sitting at his door in hope and expectation; He spoke to them, saying, O stricken ones!","The desires of all of you have been granted by God; Arise, walk without pain or affliction, acknowledge the mercy and beneficence of God!","Then all, as camels whose feet are shackled, when you loose their feet in the road, straightway rush in joy and delight to the halting-place, so did they run upon their feet at his command.","How many afflictions caused by thyself to thyself hast thou escaped through these princes of the faith?","How long that lameness of thine was thy steed!","How seldom was thy soul void of sorrow and grief!","O careless straggler, bind a rope upon thy feet, lest thou lose even thine own self!","But thy ingratitude and unthankfulness forget the honey draught thou hast sipped.","That road was perforce closed to thee when thou didst wound the hearts of the men of heart.","Quick!","clasp them and ask pardon of them; Like the clouds, shed tears of lamentation, so that their rose-garden may bloom for thee, and their ripe fruits burst open of themselves.","Press around that door, be not viler than a dog, if thou wouldest rival the Seven Sleepers dog.","Gods claims to our gratitude.","Whereas want of fidelity is shameful even in dogs, how can it be right in men?","God Almighty Himself makes boast of fidelity, saying, Who more faithful to his promise than We?","Know, infidelity is fidelity to Gods adversary, no one has pre-eminence over the rights of God.","The claims of a mother are less than Gods, for He, that bounteous One, made her debtor for thy embryo.","He gave thee a form whilst thou wast in her womb, in her womb He gave thee needful rest and nurture.","He viewed her as a part united to thee, then His wisdom separated that united part.","God devised a thousand plans and arts, to make thy mother lavish affection upon thee.","Wherefore the claims of God predominate over the mothers, whoso acknowledges not Gods claims is a fool.","He who made mother and breast and milk united mother to father also, despise Him not!","Lord, O Ancient of days, Thy mercies, whether known to us or unknown, are all from Thee!","Thou hast commanded, saying, Remember thy God, Because Gods claims are never exhausted!","Since thou hast been led astray by faithless men, turn now from thy evil doubts to the opposite mind.","I am free from error and all faithlessness; Thou must come to me and rescind evil doubts.","Cut off these evil doubts and cast them away, for in the presence of such thou becomest double.","Therefore thou hast chosen harsh friends and companions; If I ask where they are thou sayest they are gone.","The good friend goes up to highest heaven, evil friends sink beneath the bottom of the earth, whilst thou art left alone in the midst, forlorn, even as the fires left by the departed caravan.","O brave friend, grasp His skirt, who is removed alike from the world above and below; Who neither, like.","Jesus, ascends to heaven, nor, like Korah, sinks into the earth; Who will abide with thee in the house and abroad when thou lackest house and home.","He will bring forth peace out of perturbations, and when thou art afllicted will keep His promise.","How false pretensions to sanctity are distinguished from true sanctity.","O son, a hundred thousand tests await thee, whoever thou art who sayest I am a prince of the gate, If the vulgar detect not such a one by tests, yet the skilled wayfarers seek of him a sign.","When a man makes pretension to be a tailor, the master places before him a piece of silk, saying, Cut out a large head-dress, And failure in the test leads him to the pillory.","If all the evil men were not tested, every catamite would through fraud pass for a Rustam.","Suppose he wears the semblance of one clad in mail, yet when wounded he is at once taken captive.","The God-intoxicated are not sobered by old age, they remain beside themselves till the last trump.","The wine of God is true, and not false, but thou hast drunk only sour whey.","Thou makest thyself out to be a Junaid or a Bayazid; Go!","for do I not know a hatchet from a ploughshare?","plotter, how canst thou conceal by fraud baseness, sloth, covetousness, and lust?","Thou holdest thyself out as a lover of God, but thou hast coquetted with the evil demon.","The lover and the beloved on the last day will be joined together and raised in sight of all.","How foolish and silly thou hast made thyself!","Thou hast drunk blood of grapes, nay, my blood!","Go!","for I know thee not.","Get away!","I am a lover beside himself, whose words are wild.","Thou fanciest thyself near to God, saying, The maker of the dish is not far from the dish.","Knowest thou not that the nearness of saints to God involves the power to do mighty works and signs?","Iron was as wax in the hands of David, wax in thy hands is as iron.","Gods nearness and His beneficence are common to all, but only eminent saints enjoy inspired love.","Nearness is of various kinds, O son, the sun shines alike on rocks and on gold.","Yet the sun possesses a nearness to gold, whereof the common willow has no cognizance.","The dry branch and the green are alike near the sun, does the sun veil himself from either?","Yet what is the nearness of that green branch, wherefrom thou eatest ripe fruits?","But as for the dry branch) from its nearness to the sun, what does it but more quickly grow dry and sapless?","Be not intoxicated after the manner of this branch, which, when it becomes sober, has cause for repentance, but, like those drunkards who, when they drink wine, bear ripe fruits of wisdom of penitence.","Lust is that snake; How say you it is dead?","It is only frozen by the pangs of hunger.","If it obtains the state of Pharaoh, so as to command the (frozen) rivers to flow, straightway it is led to pride like Pharaohs, and it plunders the goods of many a Moses and Aaron.","Through pressure of want this snake is as a fly, it becomes a gnat through wealth and rank and luxury.","Beware, keep that snake in the frost of humiliation, draw it not forth into the sunshine of Iraq!","So long as that snake is frozen, it is well; When it finds release from frost you become its prey.","Conquer it and save yourself from being conquered, pity it not, it is not one who bears affection.","For that warmth of the sun kindles its lust, and that bat of vileness flaps its wings.","Slay it in sacred war and combat, like a valiant man will God requite you with union.","When that man cherished that snake, that stubborn brute was happy in the luxury of warmth; And of necessity worked destruction, O friend; Yea, many more mischiefs than I have told.","If you wish to keep that snake tied up without trouble, be faithful, be faithful!","But how can base men attain this wish?","It requires a Moses to slay serpents; And a hundred thousand men were slain by his serpent, in dire confusion, according to his purpose.","The eye of outward sense is as the palm of a hand, the whole of the object is not grasped in the palm.","The sea itself is one thing, the foam another; Neglect the foam, and regard the sea with your eyes.","Waves of foam rise from the sea night and day, you look at the foam ripples and not the mighty sea.","We, like boats, are tossed hither and thither, we are blind though we are on the bright ocean.","Ah!","you who are asleep in the boat of the body, you see the water; behold the Water of waters!","Under the water you see there is another Water moving it, within the spirit is a Spirit that calls it.","Where were Moses and Jesus when that Sun showered down water on the fields sown with corn?","Where were Adam and Eve what time god Almighty fitted the string to His bow?","The one form of speech is evil and defective; The other form, which is not defective, is perfect.","If I speak thereof your feet stumble, yet if I speak not of it, woe be to you!","And if I speak in terms of outward form, you stick fast in that same form, O son.","You are footbound like the grass in the ground, and your head is shaken by the wind uncertainly.","Your foot stands not firmly till you move it, nay) till you pluck it not up from the mire.","When you pluck up your foot you escape from the mire, the way to this salvation is very difficult.","When you obtain salvation at Gods hands, O wanderer, you are free from the mire, and go your way.","When the suckling is weaned from its nurse, it eats strong meats and leaves the nurse.","You are bound to the bosom of earth like seeds, strive to be weaned through nutriment of the heart.","Eat the words of wisdom, for veiled light is not accepted in preference to unveiled light.","When you have accepted the light, O beloved, when you behold what is veiled without a veil, like a star you will walk upon the heavens; Nay, though not in heaven, you will walk on high.","Keep silence, that you may hear Him speaking words unutterable by tongue in speech.","Keep silence, that you may hear from that Sun things inexpressible in books and discourses.","Keep silence, that the Spirit may speak to you; Give up swimming and enter the ark of Noah; Not like Canaan when he was swimming, who said, I desire not to enter the ark of Noah passing by.","Noah and his unbelieving son Canaan.","Noah cried, Ho!","child, come into the ark and rest, that you be not drowned in the flood, O weak one.","Canaan said, Nay!","I have learned to swim, i have lit a forch of my own apart from thy forch.","Noah replied, Make not light of it, for tis the flood of destruction, swimming with hands and feet avails naught today.","The wind of wrath and the storm blow out forches; Except the forch of God, all are extinguished.","He answered Nay!","I am going to that high mountain, for that will save me from all harm.","Noah cried, Beware, do not so, mountains are now as grass; Except the Friend none can save thee.","He answered, Why should I listen to thy advice?","For thou desirest to make me one of thy flock.","Thy speech is by no means pleasing to me, i am free from thee in this world and the next.","Thus the more good advice Noah gave him, the more stubborn refusals he returned.","Neither was his father tired of advising Canaan, nor did his advice make any impression on Canaan; While they were yet talking a violent wave smote Canaans head, and he was overwhelmed.","Reconciliatian of the two traditions, Acquiescence in infidelity is infidelity and Whoso acquiesces not in gods ordinance desires another Lord besides me.","Yesterday an inquirer questioned me, since he was interested in the foregoing narrative, saying, The Prophet, whose words are as a seal, said, Acquiescence in infidelity is infidelity And again, Acquiescence in Gods ordinance is incumbent on all true believers.","Infidelity and hypocrisy are not ordained of God; If I acquiesce in them I am at variance with God.","And yet, if I acquiesce not, that again is wrong; What way of escape is there from this dilemma?"," I said to him, This infidelity is ordained, not ordinance, though this infidelity is the work of the ordinance.","Therefore distinguish the ordinance from the ordained, that thy difficulty may be at once removed.","I acquiesce in infidelity so far as it is Gods ordinance, not so far as it is our evil and foul passions.","Infidelity qua ordinance is not infidelity, call not God an infidel.","Set not foot in this place.","Infidelity is folly, ordained infidelity wisdom, how can mercy and vengeance be the same?","Ugliness of the picture is not ugliness of the painter, not so, for he erases ugly pictures.","The ability of the painter is shown in this, that he can paint both ugly and beautiful pictures.","If I should pursue this argument properly, so that questions and answers should be prolonged, the unction of the mystery of love would escape me, the picture of obedience would become another picture.","Bewilderment from intense love of God puts an end to all thinking and argument.","A certain man whose hair was half gray came in haste to a barber who was a friend of his, saying, Pluck out the white hairs from my beard, for I have selected a young bride, O my son.","The barber cut off his beard and laid it before him, saying, Do you part them, the task is beyond me.","Questions are white and answers black; do you choose, for the man of faith knows not how to choose.","Thus, one smote Zaid a blow, and Zaid attacked him for his treachery.","The striker said, Let me first ask you a question, give me an answer to it and then strike me; I struck your back and a bruise appeared, now I ask you a question in all kindliness, did this bruise proceed from my hand, or from the smitten part of your back, O complainer?","Zaid replied, Through pain I am not in a condition to enter upon thought and consideration of this.","You, who are free from pain, think this out; Such trifling thoughts occur not to a man in pain.","Men in pain have no time for other thoughts, whether you enter mosque or Christian church.","Your carelessness and injustice suggest thoughts and unprecedented difficulties to your imagination.","The man in pain cares only for the faith, he is aware only of man and his work.","He sets Gods command upon his head and face, and for thinking, he puts it aside.","Whoso is restricted to religious raptures is but a man; Sometimes his rapture is excessive, sometimes deficient.","The Sufi is, as it were, the son of the season, But the pure (Safi) is exalted above season and state.","Religious raptures depend on feelings and will, but the pure one is regenerated by the breath of Jesus.","You are a lover of your own raptures, not of me; You turn to me only in hope of experiencing raptures.","Whoso is now defective, now perfect, is not adored by Abraham; he is one that sets.","Because the stars set, and are now up, now down, he loved them not; I love not them that set.","Whoso is now pleasing and now unpleasing is at one time water, at another fire.","He may be the house of the moon, but not the true moon; Or as the picture of a mistress, but not the living one.","The mere Sufi is the  child of the season; He clings to seasons as to a father, but the pure one is drowned in overwhelming love.","A child of any one is never free from season and state.","The pure one is drowned in the light cc that is not begotten, What begets not and is not begotten is God.","Go I seek such love as this, if you are alive; If not, you are enslaved by varying seasons.","Gaze not on your own pictures, fair or ugly, gaze on your love and the object of your desire.","Gaze not at the sight of your own weakness or vileness, gaze at object of your desire, O exalted one.","Little is known by any one but the spiritual man, who has in his heart a touchstone of vital truth.","The others, hovering between two opinions, fly towards their nest on a single wing.","Knowledge has two wings, opinion only one wing; Opinion is weak and lopsided in its flight.","The bird having but one wing quickly drops down, and again flies on two steps or more.","This bird of opinion goes on rising and falling on one wing, in hope to reach his nest.","When he escapes from opinion and knowledge is seen, this bird gains two wings and spreads both of them.","Afterwards he goes upright on a straight path, not grovelling on his face or creeping.","He flies up on two wings even as the angel Gabriel, free of opinion, of duplicity, and of vain talk.","Though the whole world say to him, Thou art firm in the road of Gods faith, He is not made more ardent by their saying this, nor is his lofty soul inclined from its course.","And though all say to him, Thou art in the wrong way thou thinkest thyself a rock who art but a blade of grass, he relapses not into opinion at their rebukes, nor is he vexed at their malevolence.","Nay, even if sea and mountains should cry out, saying, Thou art mated with error, He would not relapse one jot into vain imaginations, nor would he be grieved by the reproaches of his foes.","All things dependent upon the will of God.","Therefore hath God commanded, Make an exception, couple the words If God will with your vows.","Because the governance of actions is in my hands, the wills of all are subject to my will.","Every moment I impart a fresh bias to the heart, every instant I set a fresh mark on the heart; Each day I am engaged in a fresh work, there is naught that swerves from my purpose.","There is a tradition, The heart is like a feather in the desert, which is borne captive by the winds; The wind drives it everywhere at random, now to right and now to left in opposite directions.","According to another tradition, know the heart is like to water in a kettle boiling on the fire.","So every moment a fresh purpose occurs to the heart, not proceeding from itself, but from its situation.","Why, then, are you confident about the hearts purposes?","Why make you vows only to be covered with shame?","All these changes proceed from the effect of Gods will; Although you see the pit, you cannot avoid it.","The strange thing is, not that winged fowl fall into the deadly snare without seeing it, but that they see the snare and the limed twig, and yet fall into it, whether they will or no; Their eyes and ears are open and the snare is in front, yet they fly into the snare with their own wings!","Comparison of the divine decrees to something that is hidden, yet whose effects are seen.","Behold that kings son clad in rags, with bare head and fallen into distress; Consumed by lusts and riotous living, having sold all his clothes and substance; Having lost house and home, utterly disgraced, fulfilling the desire of his enemies by his disgrace.","If he sees a pious man he cries, O sir, aid me, for the love of God; For I have fallen into this dire disgrace; I have squandered goods and gold and wealth.","Aid me so that perchance I may escape hence, and extricate myself from this deep slough.","He repeats this prayer to high and low, Release me, release me, release me!","His eyes and ears are open, and he is free from bonds, no jailer watches him, no chain binds him; What, then, is the bond from which he asks release?","What is the prison from which ho seeks an exit?","Tis the bond of Gods purpose and hidden decrees; Ah!","none but the pure in sight can see that bond; Though not visible, that bond exists in concealment; Tis more stringent than prison or chains of iron, for the mason can pull down prison walls, and blacksmiths can break asunder iron chains; But, strange to say, this ponderous hidden bond, blacksmiths are impotent to break this asunder!","Ahmad alone could see that bond on Omm Jahils back, and the rope of palm fiber bound upon her neck; Yea, he saw wood on the back of the wife of Bu Lahab, and she, the bearer of the firewood, said it was heavy.","No eye but his saw that rope and that firewood, for to him things unseen were visible.","The others explained it, saying that Ahmad was beside himself, and they in their senses.","Nevertheless from the weight of the load her back bent, and she complained of its weight before him, saying, Aid me to escape from this load, and to shake off this grievous burden.","He who sees clearly these indications, does he not know also the doomed from the elect?","Yea, he knows them, yet conceals it by command of God, since God permits him not to reveal it.","He turned to his wife and said, O dame, the harvest of December is not as that of July; Though they be dead or though they be living, are they not equally visible to the eyes of the heart?","I behold them clearly before me, wherefore should I disfigure my countenance like you?","Though they have gone forth by revolution of fortune, they are with me still, playing round me.","The cause of lamentation is separation or parting, but I am still with my dear ones, and embrace them.","Ordinary people may see them in dreams, but I see them clearly, though wide awake.","I conceal myself a while from this world, i shake down the leaves of outward sense from the tree.","Know, O wife, outward sense is captive to reason, and reason, again, is captive to spirit.","Spirit unlooses the chained hands of reason; Yea, it opens all things that are closed.","Sensations and thoughts resemble weeds which occupy the surface of pure water.","The hand of reason puts these weeds aside, and the pure water is then visible to the wise.","Weeds in plenty cover the stream like bubbles; When they are swept aside, the water is seen; But when God unlooses not the hands of reason, the weeds on our water grow thick through carnal lust; Yea, they cover up your water more and more, while your lust is smiling and your reason weeping.","When fear of God binds the hands of lust, then God unlooses the two hands of reason.","Then the powerful senses are subdued by you, when you submit to reason as your commander then your sleepless sense is lulled into sleep, that mysteries may appear to the soul.","You behold visions when broad awake, and the gates of heaven are open before you.","He said, This at least is notorious to all men, that the world obeys the command of God.","Not a leaf falls from a tree without the decree and command of that Lord of lords; Not a morsel goes from the mouth down the throat till God says to it, Go down.","Desire and appetite, which are the reins of mankind, are themselves subservient to the rule of God.","Hear this much, that, whereas the totality of actions is not effected without Gods direction, when the decree of God becomes the pleasure of man, then man desires the fulfillment of Gods decrees; And this too spontaneously, not in hope of reward, but because his very nature is congruous therewith.","He desires not even his own life for himself, nor is he relying on the hope of sweets of life to come.","Whatever path is taken by the eternal decree, whether it be life or death, tis all one to him.","He lives for the sake of God, not for wealth; He dies for the sake of God, not in fear and grief.","His faith is based on his desire to do Gods will, not on hope to gain paradise with its groves and founts.","His avoidance of infidelity is also for Gods sake, it proceeds not from fear of falling into the fire.","Thus this temper of his arises from his very nature, not from any discipline and endeavor of his own.","At times he laughs when he contemplates Gods pleasure, gods decrees are to him as sweetmeats of sugar.","I ask, does not the world march agreeably to the will and commands of a man rejoicing in this disposition?","Why, then, should such a one make prayers and petitions, saying, O God, change such and such a decree?","His own death and his childrens deaths for Gods sake seem to him as sweets in the mouth.","In the view of that faithful one his childrens deaths are as sweetmeats to a starving beggar.","Why, therefore, should he make prayers unless he pray for what is pleasing to God?","These prayers and petitions, not those of self-pity make that man to be endued with salvation.","He utterly burned up all his self-pity, at the time when he lit the lamp of love to God.","His love was the hell that burned up his inclinations; Yea, ho burned up his own inclinations one by one.","That Daquqi possessed a sweet aspect, as a lover of God and a worker of miracles.","He resembled the moon of heaven come down on earth, he was as a light to them that walked in darkness.","He rarely tarried in one place, and seldom stayed two days in one village.","He said, If I tarry in one house two days, attachment to that house becomes a passion with me.","I guard myself from being deceived into loving a home; Up!","Soul, and travel in search of eternal wealth.","My hearts inclination is not satisfied by houses, so that they should be places of temptation for me.","Thus by day he traveled, and by night prayed, his eyes were always gazing on the King as a falcons; Cut off from mankind, though not for any fault, severed from men and women, though not for baseness; Having compassion on mankind, and wholesome as water, a kind intercessor, and one whose prayers were heard.","Benevolent to the good and the bad, and a firm ally, better than a mother, and kinder than a father.","The Prophet said, To you, O blessed ones, i am as a father, affectionate and indulgent; For this cause, that you are all portions of me.","Wherefore should you tear away the parts from the whole?","If the part be severed from its whole it is useless; If a limb be rent from the body it dies.","Till it is again joined to its whole, Tis a dead thing, and a stranger to life.","Thus Daquqi, in devotions and praises and prayers, was ever seeking the particular favorites of God.","Throughout his long journeys his object was this, to interchange a word with the favorites of God.","He cried continually as he went his way, O Lord, let me draw near to Thy chosen ones!","So Daquqi (the mercy of God be upon him!) Said, I journeyed long time to East and to West, i journeyed years and months for love of that Moon, heedless of the way, absorbed in God.","With bare feet I trod upon thorns and flints, seeing I was bewildered, and beside myself, and senseless.","Think not my feet touched the earth, for the lover verily travels with the heart.","What knows the heart of road and stages?","What of distant and near, while it is drunk with love?","Distance and nearness are attributes of bodies, the journeys of spirits are after another sort.","You journeyed from the embryo state to rationality without footsteps or stages or change of place, the journey of the soul involves not time and place.","And my body learnt from the soul its mode of journeying now my body has renounced the bodily mode of journeying it journeys secretly and without form, though under a form.","He added, One day I was thus filled with longing to behold in human form the splendours of The Friend, To witness the Ocean gathered up into a drop, the Sun compressed into a single atom; And when I drew near to the shore of the sea the day was drawing to a close.","All religions are in substance one and the same.","In the adorations and benedictions of righteous men the praises of all the prophets are kneaded together.","All their praises are mingled into one stream, all the vessels are emptied into one ewer.","Because He that is praised is, in fact, only One, in this respect all religions are only one religion.","Because all praises are directed towards Gods light, their various forms and figures are borrowed from it.","Men never address praises but to One deemed worthy, they err only through mistaken opinions of Him.","So, when a light falls upon a wall, that wall is a connecting-link between all its beams; Yet when it casts that reflection back to its source, it wrongly shows great as small, and halts in its praises.","Or if the moon be reflected in a well, and one looks down the well, and mistakenly praises it, in reality he is intending to praise the moon, although, through ignorance, he is looking down the well.","The object of his praises is the moon, not its reflection; His infidelity arises from mistake of the circumstances.","That well-meaning man goes wrong through his mistake; The moon is in heaven, and he fancies it in the well.","By these false idols mankind are perplexed, and driven by vain lusts to their sorrow.","The hands and feet of criminals betray their crimes even in this world.","He of himself lifted the veil that hid his crime; Had he not done so, God would have kept it hidden.","Criminals and sinners, even in the course of sinning, themselves rend the coverings of their crimes.","Their sins are veiled among the hearts secrets, yet the criminal himself exposes them to view, saying, Behold me wearing a pair of horns, a cow of hell in sight of all men.","Thus, even here, in the midst of thy sin, thy hand and foot bear witness of the secrets of thy heart.","Thy secret thought is as a governor who says to thee, Tell forth thy convictions, withhold them not; Especially in seasons of passion and angry talk it betrays thy secrets one by one.","Thy secret sins and crimes govern hand and foot, saying, Disclose us to men, O hand and foot!","And since these witnesses take the bit in their mouths, especially in times of passion and wrath and revenge, therefore the same God who appointed this governor to blazen forth thy secret sins to the world is also able to create many more governors to divulge thy secret sins on the day of judgment.","man whose only handiwork is crime and sin; Thy secret sins are manifest; no divulging is needed.","There is no need to proclaim thy sins, all men are cognizant of thy sin-burnt heart.","Thy soul every moment casts up sparks of fire, which say, See me a man destined to the fire; I am a part of the fire, and go to join my whole; Not a light, so that I should join the Source of light.","Comparison of lust to the murderer in the story.","Kill thine own lust and give life to the world; It has killed its lord, reduce it to servitude.","That claimant of the cow is thy lust; Beware!","It has made itself lord and master.","That slayer of the cow is thy reason; Go!","Be not obdurate to the prayers of him that kills the cow.","Reason is a poor captive, and ever cries to God for meat on its dish without laboring and toiling.","On what depends its getting meat without toiling?","On its killing the cow of the body, the source of evil.","Lust says, Why hast thou killed my cow?","It says, Because lusts cow is the form of the body.","Reason, the Lords child, has become a pauper, lust, the murderer, has become a lord and chief.","Knowst thou what is meat untoiled for?","Tis the food of spirits and the aliment of the Prophet.","But it is attainable only by slaying the cow; Treasure is gained by digging, O digger of treasure!","Not every one can properly use similitudes and parables in divine matters.","The faculty of using similitudes is peculiar to a saint who is signally marked by knowledge of hidden mysteries.","What know you of the mystery hid in aught, that you in your folly should use similitudes of curl and cheek?","Moses took his staff to be a stick, though it was not; It was a serpent, and its mystery was revealed.","If a saint such as he knew not the mystery of a stick, what know you of the mystery of the snare and grains?","When the eye of a Moses erred as to a similitude, how can a presumptuous mouse understand one?","Those similitudes of yours are changed into serpents to tear you into pieces with their jaws.","Such a parable did cursed Iblis use, so that he became cursed of God till the day of doom.","Such a parable did Korah use in his argument, so that he was swallowed up in the earth with his wealth.","Such parables know to be as crows and owls, whereby a hundred households are annihilated.","When Noah was building the ark in the desert, a hundred parable-mongers attacked him with irony, saying, In the desert, where is no water or well, he builds a boat!","What ignorant folly is this!","The arguments of the Jabriyan, i.e., the Fatalists or Compulsionists.","The men of Saba said, O preachers, enough!","What you say is enough, if there are any wise here.","God has placed a lock upon our hearts, And no man can overcome the Creator.","That great Painter has painted us thus; His painting cannot be altered by argument.","Keep telling forever a stone to become a ruby, keep telling forever the old to become young!","Tell earth to assume the quality of water, bid water to become honey or milk!","God is the creator of heaven and them that dwell therein; Also of water and of earth, and them that dwell therein; To heaven He gave its revolutions and its purity, to the earth its dark look and appearance.","Can the heaven will to become as dregs?","Can earth will to assume the clearness of pure wine?","That Person has assigned to each its lot, can mountain by endeavor become as grass?","The prophets answered, Verily God has created some qualities in you which you cannot alter; But He has created other accidental qualities, which, being objectionable, may be made good.","Bid stone become gold that is impossible; Bid copper become gold that is possible.","Bid sand bloom as a rose it cannot; Bid dust turn to mud that is within its capacity.","God has sent some pains for which there is no cure, such, for instance, as lameness, loss of nose, and blindness.","God has sent other pains for which there are cures, to wit, crooked mouth and headache.","God has ordained these remedies of His mercy; The use of these in pain and anguish is not in vain.","Nay, the majority of pains may be cured; When you seek those cures earnestly you find them.","The men of Saba replied, O men, these pains of ours are not of the sort that admit of cure.","Long time ye utter these presages and warnings, but our bonds are made thereby heavier every moment.","If our sickness admitted of a cure, it would certainly have been lessened by your spells.","When the body is obstructed water reaches not the liver, though one drinks the ocean, it passes elsewhere.","Then of course the hands and feet become dropsical, and.","yet that draught does not quench his thirst.","The prophets replied, To despair is wrong, the mercy and grace of God are boundless.","One must not despair of the grace of such a Benefactor, one must cling to the stirrup-straps of God.","Ah!","many are the conditions which at first are hard, but, are afterwards relieved and lose their harshless.","Oftentimes hope succeeds to hopelessness, many times does sunlight succeed to darkness.","We admit that ye are weighted as with stones, and that ye have locks upon your ears and your hearts.","No condition of ours is altogether as we wish, our business is to be resigned and to obey.","God has enjoined this servitude upon us; We say not this merely on our own authority.","We enjoy life on condition of doing His will; If He bids us, we sow our seed upon the sand.","The soul of the prophet cares for naught but God, it has naught to do with approving or disapproving His works.","The men of Saba replied, If ye yourselves are happy, ye make us miserable and annoy and disturb us.","Our souls were void of all anxieties, and ye have plunged us into cares and anxieties.","The comfort and harmony which we enjoyed heretofore have been rent in pieces by your evil presages.","We used to be as parrots munching sugar, ye have made us as fowls brooding on death.","On every side stories inspiring anxiety, on every side sounds exciting fears: On every side in the world an evil presage, on every side evil portents threatening punishment: This is the burden of your parables and presages, this the purport of your awe-inspiring stories.","The prophets replied, Our evil presages are corroborated by the state of your souls.","Suppose you are sleeping in a place of danger, and serpents are drawing near to bite your heads, a kind friend will inform you of your danger, saying, Jump up, lest the serpent devour you.","You reply, Why do you utter evil presages?","He answers, What presage?","Up, and see for yourself!","By means of this evil presage I rouse you, and release you from danger and lead you to your home.","Like a prophet he warns you of hidden danger, for a prophet sees what worldlings cannot see.","Mercy inclines the good to devotion, but vengeance the bad.","If you do a kindness to a generous man, tis fitting, for each kindness he will return seven hundredfold.","When you treat a base man with scorn and contumely, he will become your slave in all sincerity.","Infidels when enjoying prosperity do wrong, when they are in hell they cry, O our Lord!","For base men are purified when they suffer evil, and when they enjoy prosperity they do evil.","Wherefore the mosque of their devotion is hell, as the snare is the fetter of wild fowl.","The prison is the hermitage of the wicked thief, for when he is there he is ever crying to God.","Whereas the object of mans being is to worship God, hell is ordained as a place of worship for the proud; Man has the power to engage in any actions soever, but worship of God is the main object of his existence.","Read the text, I have not created Jinns and men but to worship me.","The only object of the world is to worship God.","Though the object of a book is to teach an art, if you make a pillow of it, it serves that purpose too.","Yet its main object is not to serve as a pillow, but to impart knowledge and useful instruction.","If you use a sword for a tent-peg, you prefer the worse use of it to the better.","Though the object of all mens being is wisdom, yet each man has a different place of worship.","The place of worship of the noble is nobility, the place of worship of the base is degradation.","Smite the base to make them bow the head.","Give to the noble to make them repay liberally.","Inasmuch as the base are evil and arrogant, hell and humbling are the small gate for them.","Verily God has created two places of adoration, hell for the base and increased bliss for the noble.","Even so Moses made a small gate in Jerusalem, to make the Israelites bow the head in entering it.","The discussion is continued and illustrated by anecdotes of the Sufi who preferred a table with no food upon it, because he ever sought not-being, of Jacobs vision of joseph, and of a devout slave who obtained leave of his master to say his prayers in a mosque, but tarried there so long that the doors were shut, and he could not get out, nor his master in.","The prophets at last despaired of making any impression upon the unbelievers, but called to mind the text When at last the Apostles lost all hope, and deemed that they were reckoned as liars, our aid reached them, and we delivered whom we would, but our vengeance was not averted from the wicked.","The despair of the prophets.","The prophets said, How long, in our benevolence, shall we give to this and that one good advice?","How long shall we hammer cold iron in vain?","How long waste breath in blowing into a lattice?","Men are moved by Gods decree and fixed ordinance, as sharp-set teeth are caused by heat of belly.","Tis Primal Soul that dominates the Second Soul, fish begins to stink at the head, not the tail.","Yet be advised and keep your steed straight as an arrow, when God says Proclaim we must obey.","O men, ye know not to which party ye belong, exert yourselves then, till ye see which ye are.","When you place goods upon a ship, you do it in trust that the voyage will be prosperous; You know not which of the two events will befall you, whether you will be drowned or come safe to land.","If you say, Till I know which will be my fate i will not set foot upon the ship; Shall I be drowned on the voyage or a survivor?","Reveal to me in which class I shall be.","I shall not undertake the voyage on the chance on the bare hope of reaching land, as the rest do.","In that case no trade at all will be undertaken by you, as the secret of these two events is always hidden.","The lamp of the heart, that is a timid trader, acquires neither loss nor gain by its ventures.","Nay, it acquires loss, for it is precluded from gain; Tis the lamp that takes fire that acquires light.","Since all things are dependent on probability, religion is so first of all, for thereby you find release.","In this world no knocking at the door is possible save hope, and God knows what is best.","Probability the guide of life in religion as well as in common matters.","Religion dependent an hope and fear."," The final cause of trading is hope or probability, when traders work themselves lean as spindles.","When the merchant goes to his shop in the morning, he does so in hope and probability of gaining bread.","If you have no hope of getting bread, why go?","There is the fear of loss, since you are not strong.","But does not this fear of utter loss in your trade become weakened in the course of your exertions?","You say, Although the fear of loss is before me, yet I feel greater fear in remaining idle.","I have a better hope through exerting myself; My fear is increased by remaining idle.","Why then, O faint-hearted one, in the matter of religion are you paralysed by the fear of loss?","See you not how the traders in this market of ours make large profits, both apostles and saints?","What a mine of wealth awaits them on leaving it, seeing they make such profits while still here!","Fire is soft to them as cotton raiment, the ocean bears them gently like a porter; Iron in their hands is soft as wax, the winds are their obedient slaves.","In difficulties there is provided a way of salvation.","In this tale there is a warning for thee, O Soul, that thou mayest acquiesce in Gods ordinances, and be wary and not doubt Gods benevolence, when sudden misfortunes befall thee.","Let others grow pale from fear of ill fortune, do thou smile like the rose at loss and gain; For the rose, though its petals be forn asunder, still smiles on, and it is never cast down.","It says, Why should I fall into grief in disgrace?","I gather beauty even from the thorn of disgrace.","Whatsoever is lost to thee through Gods decree know of a surety is so much gained from misfortune.","What is Sufiism?","Tis to find joy in the heart whensoever distress and care assail it.","Know troubles to be that eagle of the Prophets which carried off the sandal of that holy one, in order to save his foot from the bite of the viper o excellent device!","to preserve him from harm.","Tis said, Mourn not for your slaughtered cattle if a wolf has harried your flocks; For that calamity may avert a greater calamity, and that loss may ward off a more grievous loss.","God said, Do thou grant his earnest request, enlarge his faculty according to his freewill.","Freewill is as the salt to piety, otherwise heaven itself were matter of compulsion.","In its revolutions reward and punishment were needless, for tis freewill that has merit at the great reckoning.","If the whole world were framed to praise God, there would be no merit in praising God.","Place a sword in his hand and remove his impotence, to see if he turns out a warrior or a robber.","Because freewill is that wherewith we honor Adam, Half the swarm become bees and half wasps.","The faithful yield honeycombs like bees, the infidels yield store of poison like wasps.","For the faithful feed on choice herbs, so that, like bees, their chyle yields life-giving food, whilst infidels feed on filth and garbage, and generate poison according to their food.","Men inspired of God are the fountain of life; Men of delusions are a synonym for death.","In the world the praise Well done faithful servant!","Is given to freewill which is used with prudence.","If all dissolute men were shut up in prison, they would all be temperate and devout and pious.","When power of choice is absent actions are worthless; But beware lest death snatch away your capital!","Your power of choice is a capital yielding profit, remember well the day of final account!","The difference between knowing a thing merely by similitudes and on the authority of others, and knowing the very essence thereof.","Gods mercy is known through the fruits thereof, but who save God knows His essence?","No one knows the very essence of Gods attributes but only in their effects and by similitudes.","A child knows naught of the nature of sexual intercourse, except what you tell him, that it is like sweetmeats.","Yet how far does the pleasure of sexual intercourse really resemble that derived from sweetmeats?","Nevertheless the fiction produces a relation between you, with your perfect knowledge, and the child; So that the child knows the matter by a similitude, though he knows not its essence or actual nature.","Hence if he says, I know it, tis not far wrong and if he says, I know it not, tis not wrong.","Should one say, Do you know Noah, that prophet of God and luminary of the Spirit?","If you say, Do I not know him, for that moon is more famed than the sun and moon of heaven?","Little children in their schools, and elders in their mosques, all read his name prominently in the Koran, and preachers tell his story from times of yore; You say true, for you know him by report, though the real nature of Noah is not revealed to you.","On the other hand, if you say, What know I of Noah as his contemporaries knew him?","I am a poor ant what can I know of the elephant?","What knows a fly of the motions of the elephant?","This statement also is true, O brother, seeing that you know not his real nature.","But this impotence to perceive real essence, though common to ordinary men, is not universal; Because essence and its deepest secrets are open and manifest to the eyes of the perfect.","Negation and affirmation of one proposition are lawful; When the aspects differ the relation is double.","Thou castest not when thou castest shows such relation, here negation and affirmation are both correct.","Thou castest it, since it is in thy hand, thou castest not, since tis God who affords the strength.","The might of the sons of Adam is limited, how can a handful of sand shatter an army?","The sand was in mans hands, the casting was Gods.","Owing to the two relations negation and affirmation are both true.","The infidels know the prophets, as well as they doubtless know their own children; Yea, the infidels know them as well as their own sons, by a hundred tokens and a hundred evidences, but from envy and malice conceal their knowledge, and incline themselves to say, We know them not.","So when God says in one place knows them, In another He says, None knows them beside me.","For in truth they are hid under Gods overshadowing, and none but God knows them by actual experience.","Therefore take this declaration with its context, remembering how you know and do not know Noah.","A damsel said to her lover, O fond youth, you have visited many cities in your travels; Which of those cities seems most delightful to you?","He made answer, The city wherein my love dwells.","In whatever nook my queen alights, though it be as the eye of a needle, tis a wide plain; Wherever her Yusuf-like face shines as a moon, though it be the bottom of a well, tis Paradise.","With thee, my love, hell itself were heaven, with thee a prison would be a rose-garden.","With thee hell would be a mansion of delight, without thee lilies and roses would be as flames of fire!","The answer of the Vakil to those who advised him not to court death by yielding himself up to his lord.","He said, I am a drawer of water; water attracts me, even though I know water may be my death.","No drawer of water flees from water, even though it may cause him a hundred deaths.","Though it may make my hand and belly dropsical, my love for water will never be lessened.","I should say, when they asked me about my belly, Would that the ocean might flow into it!","Though the bottle of my belly were burst with water, and though I should die, my death would be acceptable.","Wheresoever I see one seeking water, I envy him, and cry, Would I were in his place!","My hand is a tabor and my belly a drum, like the rose I beat the drum of love of water.","Like the earth or like a fetus I devour blood, since I became a lover this is my occupation.","If that Faithful Spirit should shed my blood, i would drink it up drop by drop like the earth.","At night I boil on the fire like a cooking-pot, from morn till eve I drink blood like the sand.","It repents me that I planned a stratagem, and that I fled from before his wrath.","Tell him to sate his wrath on my poor life, he is the Feast of Sacrifice, and I his loving cow.","The cow, whether it eats or sleeps, thinks of naught but sacrificing itself.","Know me to be that cow of Moses which gave its life, each part of me gives life to the righteous.","That cow of Moses was made a sacrifice, and its least part became a source of life.","That murdered man leapt up from his deadness at the words, Strike the corpse with part of her.","pious ones, slay the cow (of lust), if ye desire true life of soul and spirit!","I died as inanimate matter and arose a plant, i died as a plant and rose again an animal.","I died as an animal and arose a man.","Why then should I fear to become less by dying?","I shall die once again as a man to rise an angel perfect from head to foot!","Again when I suffer dissolution as an angel, i shall become what passes the conception of man!","Let me then become non-existent, for non-existence sings to me in organ tones, To him shall we return.","Know death to be the gathering together of the people.","The water of life is hidden in the land of darkness.","Like a water-lily seek life there!","Yea, like that drawer of water, at the risk of life, water will be his death, yet he still seeks water, and still drinks on, and God knows what is right.","O lover, cold-hearted and void of loyalty, who from fear for your life shun the beloved!","O base one, behold a hundred thousand souls dancing towards the deadly sword of his love: Behold water in a pitcher; pour it out; Will that water run away from the stream?","When that water joins the water of the stream it is lost therein, and becomes itself the stream.","Its individuality is lost, but its essence remains, and hereby it becomes not less nor inferior.","I will hang myself upon my lords palm-tree in excuse for having fled away from him!","Even as a ball rolling along on head and face, he fell at the feet of the Prince with streaming eyes.","The people were all on the alert, expecting that the Prince would burn him or hang him, saying, Moth-like he has seen the blaze of the light, and fool-like has plunged therein and lost his life.","But the forch of love is not like that forch, Tis light, light in the midst of light, Tis the reverse of forches of fire, it appears to be fire, but is all sweetness.","Love generates love.","If ye love God, God will love you."," That Bokharian then cast himself into the flame, but his love made the pain endurable; And as his burning sighs ascended to heaven, the love of the Prince was kindled towards him.","The heart of man is like the root of a tree, therefrom grow the leaves on firm branches.","Corresponding to that root grow up branches as well on the tree as on souls and intellects.","The tops of the perfect trees reach the heavens, the roots firm, and the branches in the sky.","Since then the tree of love has grown up to heaven, how shall it not also grow in the heart of the Prince?","A wave washes away the remembrance of the sin from his heart, for from each heart is a window to other hearts.","Since in each heart there is a window to other hearts, they are not, separated and shut off like two bodies.","Thus, even though two lamp-dishes be not joined, yet their light is united in a single ray.","No lover ever seeks union with his beloved, but his beloved is also seeking union with him.","But the lovers love makes his body lean, while the beloveds love makes hers fair and lusty.","When in this heart the lightning spark of love arises, be sure this love is reciprocated in that heart.","When the love of God arises in thy heart, without doubt God also feels love for thee.","The noise of clapping of hands is never heard from one of thy hands unaided by the other hand the man athirst cries, Where is delicious water?","Water too cries, Where is the water-drinker?","This thirst in my soul is the attraction of the water; I am the waters and the water is mine.","Gods wisdom in His eternal foreknowledge and decree made us to be lovers one of the other.","Nay more, all the parts of the world by this decree are arranged in pairs, and each loves its mate.","Every part of the world desires its mate, just as amber attracts blades of straw.","Heaven says to earth, All hail to thee!","We are related to one another as iron and magnet.","Heaven is man and earth woman in character; Whatever heaven sends it, earth cherishes.","When earth lacks heat, heaven sends heat; When it lacks moisture and dew, heaven sends them.","The earthy sign succours the terrestrial earth, the watery sign (Aquarius) sends moisture to it; The windy sign sends the clouds to it, to draw off unwholesome exhalations.","The fiery sign (Leo) sends forth the heat of the sun, like a dish heated red-hot in front and behind.","The heaven is busily toiling through ages, just as men labor to provide food for women.","And the earth does the womans work, and toils in bearing offspring and suckling them.","Know then earth and heaven are endued with sense, since they act like persons endued with sense.","If these two lovers did not suck nutriment from each other, why should they creep together like man and wife?","Without the earth how could roses and saffron grow?","For naught can grow from the sole heat and rain of heaven.","This is the cause of the female seeking the male, that the work of each may be accomplished.","God has instilled mutual love into man and woman, that the world may be perpetuated by their union.","Earth says to the earth of the body, Come away, quit the soul and come to me as dust.","Thou art of my genus, and wilt be better with me, Thou hadst better quit the soul and fly to me!","Body replies True, but my feet are fast bound, though like thee I suffer from separation.","Water calls out to the moisture of the body, O moisture, return to me from your foreign abode!","Fire also calls out to the heat of the body, Thou art of fire; return to thy root!","In the body there are seventy-and-two diseases; It is ill compacted owing to the struggle of its elements.","Disease comes to rend the body asunder, and to drag apart its constituent elements.","The four elements are as birds tied together by the feet; Death, sickness and disease loose their feet asunder.","The moment their feet are loosed from the others, The bird of each element flies off by itself.","The repulsion of each of these principles and causes inflicts every moment a fresh pang on our bodies.","That it may dissolve these composite bodies of ours, the bird of each part tries to fly away to its origin; But the wisdom of God prevents this speedy end, and preserves their union till the appointed day.","He says, O parts, the appointed time is not yet; It is useless for you to take wing before that day.","But as each part desires reunion with its original, how is it with the soul who is a stranger in exile?","It says, O parts of my habitation here below, my absence is sadder than yours, as I am heaven-born.","The body loves green pastures and running water, for this cause that its origin is from them.","The love of the soul is for life and the living one, because its origin is the Soul not bound to place.","The love of the soul is for wisdom and knowledge, that of the body for houses, gardens, and vineyards; The love of the soul is for things exalted on high, that of the body for acquisition of goods and food.","The love too of Him on high is directed to the soul: Know this for He loves them that love Him.","The sum is this, that whoso seeks another, the soul of that other who is sought inclines to him.","Let us quit the subject.","Love for that soul athirst was kindled in the breast of the Prince of Bokhara.","The smoke of that love and the grief of that burning heart ascended to his master and excited his compassion.","The praises addressed to the Prince by the Vakil.","He said, O phoenix of God and goal of the spirit i thank thee that thou hast come back from Mount Qaf] O Israfil of the resurrection-day of love, o love, love, and hearts desire of love!","Let thy first boon to me be this, to lend thine ear to my orisons.","Though thou knowest my condition clearly, o protector of slaves, listen to my speech.","A thousand times, O prince incomparable, has my reason taken flight in desire to see thee, and to hear thee and to listen to thy words, and to behold thy life-giving smiles.","Thy inclining thine ear to my supplications is as a caress to my misguided soul.","The baseness of my hearts coin is known to thee, but thou hast accepted it as genuine coin.","Thou art proud towards the arrogant and proud; All clemencies are as naught to thy clemency.","First hear this, that while I remained in absence, first and last alike escaped me.","Secondly, hear this.","O prince beloved, that I searched much, but found no second to thee.","Thirdly, that when I had departed outside thee, i said it was like the Christian Trinity.","Fourthly, when my harvest was burned up, i knew not the fourth from the fifth.","Wheresoever thou findest blood on the roads, trace it, and tis tears of blood from my eyes.","My words are thunder, and these sighs and tears are drawn by it as rain from the clouds.","I am distracted between speaking and weeping.","Shall I weep, or shall I speak, or what shall I do?","If I speak, my weeping ceases; If I weep, I cease to praise and magnify thee.","He spoke thus, and then fell to weeping, so that high and low wept with him.","So many Ahs and Alases proceeded from his heart, that the people of Bokhara formed a circle round him.","Talking sadly, weeping sadly, smiling sadly, men and women, small and great, were all assembled.","The whole city wept in concert with him; Men and women mingled together as on the last day.","Then Heaven said to Earth, If you never saw a resurrection-day, see it here!","Reason was amazed, saying, What love, what ecstasy!","Is his separation more wondrous, or his reunion?","Our body and substance are snow, doomed to perish, god is He who buys them, for God hath bought them.","You prefer this perishing snow to Gods price because you are in doubt and have not certainty; And, strange to say, opinion abides in you, O weak one, and never flies away to the garden of certainty.","Every opinion is aiming at certainty, O son, and more and more moves its wings towards certainty.","When it reaches knowledge it stands erect, and its knowledge again hastes on towards certainty, because in the approved road of the faith knowledge is lower than certainty, but above opinion.","Know knowledge aspires to certainty, and certainty again to sight and ocular evidence.","In the chapter, Desire of riches occupieth you, After Nay, read Would that ye knew!","Knowledge conducts you to sight, O knower!","If ye are certain, ye shall see hell-fire.","Sight follows on certainty with no interval, just as reasoned knowledge is born of opinion.","See the account of this in the chapter cited, how knowledge of certainty becomes the eye of certainty.","As for me, I am above both opinion and certainty; My head is not affected by your cavils.","Since my mouth has eaten of His sweetmeats, i am become clear-sighted, and see him face to face!","The righteous are exposed to trials for their improvement, as potherbs are boiled to make them fit for food.","Behold these potherbs boiling in the pot, how they jump and toss about in the heat of the fire.","Whilst they are boiling, they keep leaping up, even to the top of the pot, and utter cries, saying to the housewife, Why do you set us on the fire?","Now you have bought us, why should you afflict us?","The housewife pushes them down with her spoon, saying, Be still, and boil well, and leap not off the fire.","I do not boil you because I dislike you, but that you may acquire a good savor and taste.","When you become food you will be mingled with life; This trial is not imposed on you to distress you.","In the garden you drank water soft and fresh; That water-fed one was reserved for this fire.","Mercy was first shown to it before vengeance, that mercy might train it to be proof against trial; Mercy was shown to it previously to vengeance, that it might acquire its substance of being.","Because flesh and skin grow not without tender care, how should they not grow when warmed by the Friends love.","If vengeance follows as a necessary consequence, that you may make an offering of that substance, mercy follows again to compensate for it, that you may be purified and raised above your nature.","I am Abraham, and you his son under the knife.","Lay down your head!","I have seen I must sacrifice you.","Yield your head to vengeance, your heart to constancy, that I may cut your throat like an Ismailians.","I cut off your head, but that head is such that it is restored to life by being cut off!","My main object herein is to inculcate resignation, o Mosalman!","it behoves you to seek resignation.","O potherbs, you boil in trials and sufferings that neither existence nor self may remain in you.","Though you once smiled in that earthly garden, you are really roses of the garden of life and sight.","If you are forn away from the garden of earth, you become sweet food to revive mans life; Yea, become his food and strength and thought!","You were only milk, you become a lion of the forest!","You issue from Gods attributes at first; Return again back to those attributes with all speed!","You come from the clouds and sunshine and sky, then assume moral qualities and ascend the sky.","You come in the form of rain and sunshine, you depart endued with excellent attributes.","You begin as a part of the sun, clouds, and stars, you rise to be breath, act, word, and thought!","The life of animals comes from the death of plants.","True is the saying, Kill me, O faithful ones!","Since such exaltation awaits us after death.","True it is that In our death is life.","Acts, words, and faith are the food of the King, so that in this ascent one attains to heaven.","Thus, as potherbs become the food of men, they rise above the grade of minerals to that of animals.","A certain goose pops his head out of his coop, and displays himself as a critic of the Masnavi, saying, This poem, the Masnavi, is childish; Tis but a story of the prophets, and so on.","Tis not an account of the arguments and deep mysteries, whereto holy men direct their attention; Concerning asceticism, and so on to self-annihilation, step by step, up to communion with God; An explanation and definition of each several state, whereto the men of heart ascend in their flight.","Whereas the Book of God resembles the Masnavi in this, the infidels abused it, in the same manner, saying, It contains old tales and stories; There is no deep analysis or lofty investigation therein.","Little boys can understand it; It only contains commands and prohibitions, accounts of Yusuf and his curled locks, accounts of Jacob, of Zulaikha and her love, accounts of Adam, of the wheat, and of the serpent Iblis, accounts of Hud, of Noah, of Abraham, and the fire.","Know the words of the Koran are simple, but within the outward sense is an inner secret one.","Beneath that secret meaning is a third, whereat the highest wit is dumbfoundered.","The fourth meaning has been seen by none save God, the Incomparable and All-sufficient.","Thus they go on, even to seven meanings, one by one, according to the saying of the Prophet, without doubt.","Do thou, O son, confine not thy view to the outward meaning, even as the demons saw in Adam only clay the outward meaning of the Koran is like Adams body, for its semblance is visible, but its soul is hidden.","O reviling dog!","thou makest a clamour, thou makest thy abuse of the Koran thy destruction.","This is not a lion, wherefrom thou canst save thy life, or canst secure thyself from his talons!","The Koran cries out even to the last day, O people, given up as a prey to ignorance, if ye have imagined me to be only empty fables, ye have sown the seed of reviling and infidelity.","Ye yourselves who abuse me will see yourselves annihilated, and made like a tale that is told!","Solomon and the gnat.","A gnat came in from the garden and fields, and called on Solomon for justice, saying, O Solomon, you extend your equity over demons and the sons of Adam and fairies.","Fish and fowl dwell under the shelter of your justice; Where is the oppressed one whom your mercy has not sought?","Grant me redress, for I am much afflicted, being cut off from my garden and meadow haunts.","Then Solomon replied, O seeker of redress, tell me from whom do you desire redress?","Who is the oppressor, who, puffed up with arrogance has oppressed you and smitten your face?","The gnat replied, He from whom I seek redress is the Wind, Tis he who has emitted the smoke of oppression at me; Through his oppression I am in a grievous strait, through him I drink blood with parched lip!","Solomon replied to him, O sweet voiced one, you must hear the command of God with all your heart.","God has commanded me saying, O dispenser of justice, never hear one party without the other!","Till both parties come into the presence, the truth is never made plain to the judge.","When the Wind heard the summons, it came swiftly, and the gnat instantly took flight.","In like manner the seekers of Gods presence-seat, when God appears, those seekers vanish.","Though that union is life eternal, yet at first that life is annihilation.","The lover invoked blessings on that rough patrol, because their harshness had wrought bliss for him.","They were poison to most men, but sweets to him, because those harsh ones had united him with his love.","In the world there is nothing absolutely bad; Know, moreover, evil is only relative.","In the world there is neither poison nor antidote, which is not a foot to one and a fetter to another; To one the power of moving, to another a clog; To one a poison, to another an antidote.","Serpents poison is life to serpents, in relation to mankind it is death.","To the creatures of the sea the sea is a garden, to the creatures of the land it is fatal.","In the same way, O man, reckon up with intelligence the relations of these things in endless variety.","In relation to this man Zaid is as Satan, in relation to another he is as a Sultan.","The latter calls Zaid a sincere Mussulman, the former calls him a Gueber deserving to be killed.","Zaid, one and the same person, is life to the one, and to the other an annoyance and a pest.","If you desire that God may be pleasing to you, then look at Him with the eyes of them that love Him.","Look not at that Beauty with your own eyes, look at that Object of desire with His votaries eyes; Shut your own eyes from beholding that sweet Object, and borrow from His admirers their eyes; Nay, borrow from Him both eyes and sight, and with those eyes of His look upon His face, in order that you may not be disappointed with the sight.","God says, Whoso is Gods, God also is his.","God says, I am his eye, his hand, his heart, That his good fortune may emerge from adversity.","Whatsoever is hateful to you, if it should lead you to your beloved, at once becomes agreeable to you.","Why God is named Hearing,  Seeing and Knowing.","God calls himself Seeing, to the end that his eye may every moment scare you from sinning.","God calls himself Hearing, to the end that you may close your lips against foul discourse.","God calls himself Knowing, to the end that you may be afraid to plot evil.","These names are not mere accidental names of God, as a negro may be called Kafur (white); They are names derived from Gods essential attributes, not mere vain titles of the First Cause.","For if so, they would be only empty pleasantries, like calling the deaf a hearer and the blind a seer, or a name like impudent for a modest man, or beautiful for an ugly negro, or such a title as Haji for a new-born boy, or that of Ghazi applied to a noble idler.","If such titles as these are used in praising persons who do not possess the qualities implied, tis wrong; Twould be jesting or mockery or madness.","God is exalted above what is said by evil men.","I knew you before I met you face to face; That you had a fair face but an evil heart; Yea, I knew you before I saw you, that you were rooted in iniquity through guile.","When my eye is red owing to inflammation, i know tis so from the pain, though I see it not.","You regarded me as a lamb without a shepherd; You fancied that I had no guardian.","Lovers have suffered chastisement for this cause, that they have cast ill-timed looks at fair ones.","They have supposed the fawn to have no shepherd, they have supposed the captive to be going a begging; Till in the twinkling of an eye an arrow pierces them, saying, I am her guardian; look not at her rashly!","What!","am I less than a lamb or a fallow deer, that I should have none to shepherd me?","Nay, I have a Guardian worthy of dominion, who knows every wind that blows upon me.","He is aware whether that wind is chill or mild, he is not ignorant nor absent, O mean one.","The carnal soul is made by God blind and deaf; I saw with the hearts eye your blindness afar off.","For this cause I never inquired about you for eight years because I saw you filled with ignorance and duplicity.","Why indeed should I inquire about one in the furnace, who is bowed down with reproach, like yourself?","Comparison of the world to a bath stove, and of piety to the hot bath.","The lust of the world is like a bath stove, whereby the bath of piety is heated; But the lot of the pious is purity from the stoves filth, because they dwell in the bath and in cleanliness.","The rich are as those that carry dung to heat the furnace of the bath withal.","God has instilled into them cupidity, that the bath may be warmed and pleasant.","Quit this stove and push on into the bath; Know quitting the stove to be the bath itself.","Whoso is in the stove-room is as a servant to him who is temperate and prudent.","Your lust is as fire in the world, with a hundred greedy mouths wide open.","In the judgment of reason this gold is foul dung, although, like dung, it serves to kindle the fire.","Whoso was born in the stove-room and never saw purity, the smell of sweet musk is disagreeable to him.","In illustration of this, a story follows of a tanner who was accustomed to bad smells in the course of his trade, and who was half killed by the smell of musk in the bazaar of the perfumers, but was cured by the accustomed smell of dung.","In outward form thou art the microcosm, but in reality the macrocosm.","Seemingly the bough is the cause of the fruit, but really the bough exists because of the fruit.","Were he not impelled by desire of fruit, the gardener would never have planted the tree.","Therefore in reality the tree is born from the fruit, though seemingly the fruit is born from the tree.","For this cause Mustafa said, Adam and all prophets are my followers and gather under my standard.","Though to outward view I am a son of Adam, in reality I am his first forefather, because the angels worshipped him for my sake, and twas in my footsteps that he ascended to heaven.","Hence in reality our first parent was my offspring, as in reality the tree is born of its own fruit.","What is first in thought is last in act.","Thought is the special attribute of the Eternal.","This product goes forth from heaven very swiftly, and comes to us like a caravan.","Tis not a long road that this caravan travels; Can the desert stop the deliverer?","The heart travels to the Kaba every moment, and by divine grace the body acquires the same power.","Distance and nearness affect only the body, what do they matter in the place where God is?","When God changes the body, it regards not parasangs or miles.","Even on earth there is hope of approaching God.","Press on like a lover, and cease vain words, O son!","In the course of his rebuke to the messengers of Bilqis for bringing him mere gold instead of a humble heart, Solomon tells the story of the druggist who used soapstone or Persian earth for a weight.","A man came to him to buy sugar-candy, and as he had no weight at hand, he used a lump of soapstone instead; but, while his back was turned, the purchaser stole a bit of the soapstone.","The druggist, though he saw what he was doing, would not interrupt him, for he knew that the more soapstone the purchaser stole, the less sugarcandy he would get.","In like manner the more men grasp at the transitory wealth of this world, the less they will obtain of the stable wealth of the world to come.","Part of Solomans message to Bilqis.","Report to Bilqis what marvels ye have seen, and what plains of gold belong to Solomon; How ye beheld forty mansions faced with gold, and how ye were ashamed of your presents; That she may know Solomon is not covetous of gold; He has received gold from the Creator of gold.","The moment he wills it, every grain of earths dust is changed into gold and precious pearls.","For this cause, O thou that lovest gold, on the last day God will make earth all silver (white).","Quit thy wealth, even if it be the realm of Saba; Thou wilt find many realms not of this earth.","What thou callest a throne is only a prison; Thou thinkest thyself enthroned, but art outside the door.","Thou hast no sovereignty over thine own passions, how canst thou sway good and evil?","Thy hair turns white without thy concurrence, take shame to thyself for thy evil passions.","Whoso bows his head to the King of kings will receive a hundred kingdoms not of this world; But the delight of bowing down before God will seem sweeter to thee than countless glories.","An anecdote follows of a darvesh who saw in a dream some saints, and prayed them to provide him with his daily bread without obliging him to mix in worldly affairs.","The saints ordered him to go to the forest, and there he found that all the wild fruits were rendered fit for his food.","Having a few grains of gold by him, which he had gained by worldly labour before this miracle had been wrought for him, he was about to give them to a poor woodcutter who was passing that way.","But this woodcutter was a saint, and at once read his thoughts, and to show, like Solomon, that he had no need of worldly wealth, he offered up a short prayer to god, and straightway his bundle of firewood was changed into gold, and immediately after, at another prayer, was changed back again into firewood.","Ibrahim bin Adham aud bis fondness for music.","Haste to renounce thy kingdom, like Ibrahim bin Adham, to obtain, like him, the kingdom of eternity.","At night that king would sleep on his throne, with his guards of state surrounding his palace, though he needed no guards for the purpose of warding off robbers and vagabonds; For he who is a just king knows everything, and is safe from harm and his mind is at peace.","Justice is the guardian of his steps, not guards with drums round his palace.","His purpose in having this band of music was this, to recall to his longing heart that call of God.","The wailing of horn and the thunder of drum resemble in some sort that dread trumpet blast.","Wherefore philosophers say that we have learned our melodies from those of the revolving spheres.","The song of the spheres in their revolutions is what men sing with lute and voice.","The faithful hold that the sweet influences of heaven can make even harsh voices melodious.","As we are all members of Adam, we have heard these melodies in Paradise; Though earth and water have cast their veil upon us, we retain faint reminiscences of those heavenly songs.","But while we are thus shrouded by gross earthly veils, how can the tones of the dancing spheres reach us?","Hence it is that listening to music is lovers food, because it recalls to them their primal union with God.","The inward feelings of the mind acquire strength, nay, are shown outwardly, under influence of music.","The fire of love burns hotter under stimulus of music, even as occurred in the case of the nut-gatherer.","Ibrahims abdication.","Once that noble Ibrahim, as he sat on his throne, heard a clamour and noise of cries on the roof, also heavy footsteps on the roof of his palace.","He said to himself, Whose heavy feet are those?","He shouted from his window, Who goes there?","Tis no mans step; surely tis a fairy.","His guards, filled with confusion, bowed their heads, saying, It is we who are going the rounds in search.","He said, What seek ye?","They said Our camels He said, Who ever searched for camels on a housetop?","They said, We follow thy example, who seekest union with God while sitting on a throne.","This was all, and no man ever saw him again, just as fairies are invisible to men.","His substance was hid from men, though he was with them, for what can men see save the outward aspect and dress?","As he was removed from the sight of friends and strangers, his fame was noised abroad like that of the Anka.","For the soul of every bird that reaches Mount Qaf confers glory on the whole family of birds.","I tell the tale of Saba in lovers style.","When the breeze bore Solomons words to that garden, Twas as when bodies meet souls at the resurrection, or as when boys return to their loved homes.","The people of love are hidden amongst the peoples, as a liberal man encompassed by the contumely of the base.","Souls are disgraced by union with bodies, bodies are ennobled by union with souls.","Arise, O lovers; this sweet draught is yours; Ye are they that endure; eternal life is yours.","Ho!","ye that seek, arise and take your fill of love, snuff up that perfume of Yusufi approach, O Solomon, thou that knowest birds language, sound the note of every bird that draws near; When God sent, thee to the birds, he taught thee first the notes of all the birds.","To the predestinarian bird talk predestination, to the bird with broken wings preach patience, to the patient well-doer preach comfort and pardon, to the spiritual Anka relate the glories of Mount Qaf, to the pigeon preach avoidance of the hawk, to the lordly hawk mercy and self-control; As for the bat, who lingers helpless in the dark, acquaint him with the society of the light; To the fighting partridge teach peace, to the cock the signs of dawning day.","In this way deal with all from the hoopoo to the eagle.","Then follows a long account of various miraculous incidents that occurred during the childhood of the Prophet, how he was suckled by Halima, a woman of the Bani Saad, how the idols bowed down before him, how he strayed from home, how his grandfather, Abd ul Muttalib, prayed to God that he might be found, and how he was at last found in the kaba and restored to his grandfather.","Next a story is told of a cur who attacked a blind man (Kur) in the street, rather than hunt the wild ass (Gor) on the mountains in company with well-bred dogs.","This is an illustration of the thesis that mankind is prone to run after mean earthly objects, and to neglect aspiring to the spiritual world.","Ah!","Bilqis, bestir thyself now the market is thronged, flee away from them whose traffic is unprofitable!","Arise, Bilqis, now that thou hast the choice, before that death lays his heavy hand upon thee.","Soon will death pull thy ears, as if thou wert a thief dragged before the officer in deadly fear.","How long wilt thou steal shoes from asses of the world?","If thou must steal, steal pearls of the world above.","Thy sisters have found the kingdom that lasts forever, thou cleavest to the kingdom of darkness.","Happy is he who quits this earthly kingdom, which sooner or later death will destroy.","Arise!","O Bilqis, at least behold the kingdom of the royal kings of the faith!","In reality they are seated in the garden of the spirit, though to outward view they are guiding their friends.","That spiritual garden accompanies them everywhere, yet it is never revealed to the eyes of the people, its fruits ever asking to be gathered, its fount of life welling up to be drunk!","Go round about the heavens without aid of wings, like sun or full moon or new moon!","Thou wilt move as a spirit without aid of feet, thou wilt eat sweet viands without mouth or palate.","No crocodile of sorrow will attack thy bark, nor will sad thoughts of death assail thee.","Thou wilt be at once queen, army, and throne, endued with good fortune and fortune itself.","Thou sayest thou art a great queen of good fortune; But thy fortune is apart from thee and will soon fade, thou wilt be left like a, beggar without sustenance; Therefore, O chosen one, become thy own fortune.","When, O spiritual one, thou hast become thy own fortune, then, being thyself thy fortune, thou wilt never lose it.","How.","O fortunate one, canst thou ever lose thyself, when thy real self is thy treasure and thy kingdom?","When Solomon laid the foundations of the temple, men and Jinns came and lent their aid to the work, some of them with good-will, and others on compulsion, even as worshippers follow the road of devotion.","Men are as demons, and lust of wealth their chain, which drags them forth to toil in shop and field.","This chain is made of their fears and anxieties.","Deem not that these men have no chain upon them.","It causes them to engage in labor and the chase, it forces them to toil in mines and on the sea, it urges them towards good and towards evil.","God saith, On their necks is a rope of palm fibre, And Verily on their necks have we placed ropes, We make this rope out of their own dispositions; There is none either impure or intelligent, but we have fastened his work about his neck.","Thy lust is even as fire burning in thy evil deeds; The black coal of these deeds is lighted by the fire; The blackness of the coal is first hidden by the fire, but, when it is burnt, the blackness is made visible.","The building of the prophets was without lust, and accordingly its splendor ever increased.","Yea, many are the noble temples they have raised, though all were not named The Most Remote Temple.","The Kaba, whose renown waxes greater every moment, owed its foundation to the piety of Abraham.","Its glory is not derived from stones and mortar, but from being built without lust or strife.","Neither are the prophets writings like other writings; Nor their temples, nor their works, nor their families; Nor their manners, nor their wrath, nor their chastisements; Nor their dreams, nor their reason, nor their words.","Each one of them is endued with a different glory, each souls bird winged with different feathers.","Ho!","pious ones, build the lively temple of the heart, that the Divine Solomon may be seen, and peace be upon you!","And if your demons and fairies be recalcitrant, your good angels must place collars on their necks.","If your demons go astray through guile and fraud, chastisement must overtake them swift as lightning.","Be like Solomon, so that your demons may dig stones for your spiritual edifice.","Be like Solomon, free from evil thoughts and guile, so that carnal demons and Jinns may be submissive to you.","Your heart is as Solomons signet; take good care that it falls not a prey to demons, for then demons will rule over you as over Solomon.","Guard then your signet from the demons, and be at peace.","How all creatures cry to God for sustenance.","Yea, all the fish in the seas, and all feathered fowl in the air above, all elephants, wolves, and lions of the forest, all dragons and snakes, and even little ants, yea, even air, water, earth, and fire, draw their sustenance from Him, both winter and sum- Every moment this heaven cries to Him, saying, O Lord, quit not Thy hold of me for a moment!","The pillar of my being is Thy aid and protection; The whole is folded up in that right hand of Thine.","And earth cries, O keep me fixed and steadfast, thou who hast placed me on the top of waters!","All of them are waiting and expecting His aid, all have learned of Him to represent their needs.","Every prophet extols this prescription, Seek ye help with patience and with prayer.","Ho!","seek aid of Him, not of another than Him seek water in the ocean, not in a dried-up channel.","When the body bows in worship, the heart is a temple, and where there is a temple, there bad friends are weeds when a liking for bad friends grows up in you, flee from them, and avoid converse with them.","Root up those weeds, for, if they attain full growth, they will subvert you and your temple together.","O beloved, this weed is deviation from the right way, You crawl crookedly, like infants unable to walk.","Fear not to acknowledge your ignorance and guilt, that the Heavenly Master may not withhold instruction.","When you say, I am ignorant; O teach me, Such open confession is better than false pride.","O ingenuous one, learn of our father Adam, who said of yore, O Lord, we have dealt unjustly.","He made no vain excuses and prevaricated not, nor did he raise the standard of guile and craft.","On the other hand, Iblis raised arguments, saying, I used to be honorable; Thou hast disgraced me.","My stain is owing to Thee; Thou art my dyer; Thou hast caused my sin and transgression.","Read the text, Lord, Thou hast caused me to err, That you plead not compulsion, and so err (like Iblis).","How long will you climb into that tree of compulsion?","How long cast out of sight your own freewill?","How long, like Iblis and his evil crew, throw the blame of your own sins upon God?","How were you compelled to sin when you took such pleasure and pride in engaging in those sins?","Does a man feel such pleasure in acting on compulsion as he exhibits when committing wrong actions?","You battle like twenty men against those who give you good advice not to do that act; Saying to them, This is right and quite proper; Who dissuades me from it but men of no account?","Does a man acting on compulsion talk like this?","Or rather one who is erring of his own freewill?","Whatever your lust wills you deem freewill, what reason demands you deem compulsion.","Whoso is wise and prudent knows this, that cleverness comes from Iblis, but love from Adam.","Cleverness is like Canaans swimming in the ocean; Tis no river or small stream; tis the mighty ocean.","Away with this attempt to swim; quit self-conceit.","Twill not save you; Canaan was drowned at last.","Love is as the ark appointed for the righteous, which annuls the danger and provides a way of escape.","Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment; Cleverness is mere opinion, bewilderment intuition.","Make sacrifice of your reason at the feet of Mustafa, say, God Sufficeth me, for He, is sufficient for me.","Do not, like Canaan, hang back from entering the ark, being puffed up with vain conceit of cleverness.","He said, I will escape to the top of high mountains, why need I put myself under obligation to Noah?","Ah!","better for him had he never learnt swimming!","Then he would have based his hopes on Noahs ark.","Would he had been ignorant of craft as a babe!","Then like a babe he would have clung to his mother.","Would he had been less full of borrowed knowledge!","Then he would have accepted inspired knowledge from his father.","When, with inspiration at hand, you seek book-learning, your heart, as if inspired, loads you with reproach.","Traditional knowledge, when inspiration is available, is like making ablutions with sand when water is near.","Make yourself ignorant, be submissive, and then you will obtain release from your ignorance.","For this cause, O son, the Prince of men declared, The majority of those in Paradise are the foolish.","Cleverness is as a wind raising storms of pride; Be foolish, so that your heart may be at peace; Not with the folly that doubles itself by vain babble, but with that arising from bewilderment at The Truth.","Those Egyptian women who cut their hands were fools fools as to their hands, being amazed at Yusufs face.","Make sacrifice of reason to love of The Friend, True reason is to be found where He is.","Men of wisdom direct their reason heavenwards, vain babblers halt on earth where no Friend is.","If through bewilderment your reason quits your head, every hair of your head becomes true reason and a head.","Moses said, Their sorcery confuses them; What can I do?","These people have no discernment.","God said, I will generate in them discernment; I will make their undiscerning reason to see clearly.","Although like a sea their waves cast up foam, o Moses, thou shalt prevail over them; fear not!","The magicians gloried in their own achievements, but when Moses rod became a snake, they were confounded.","Whoso boasts of his beauty and wit, the stone of death is a touchstone of his boasts.","Sorcery fades away, but the miracles of Moses advance.","Both resemble a dish falling from a roof: The noise of the dish of sorcery leaves only cursing; The noise of the dish of faith leaves edification.","When the touchstone is hidden from the sight of all, then come forth to battle and boast, O base coin!","Your time for boasting is when the touchstone is away; The hand of power will soon crush your exaltation.","The base coin says to me with pride every moment, O pure gold, how am I inferior to you?","The gold replies, Even so, O comrade; But the touchstone is at hand; be ready to meet it!","Death of the body is a benefaction to the spiritual; What damage has pure gold to dread from the shears?","If the base coin were of itself far-sighted, it would reveal at first the blackness it shows at last.","If it had showed its blackness at first on its face, Twould have avoided hypocrisy now and misery at last.","Twould have sought the alchemy of grace in due time; Its reason would have prevailed over its hypocrisy.","If it became broken-hearted through its own bad state, Twould look onward to Him that heals the broken; Twould look to the result and be broken-hearted and be made whole at once by the Healer of broken hearts.","Divine grace places base copper in the alembic, adulterated gold is excluded from that favor.","O adulterated gold, boast not, but see clearly that thy Purchaser is not blind to thy defects.","The light of the judgment-day will enlighten his eyes and destroy the glamour of thy fascinations.","Behold them that have regard to the ultimate result, and also the regrets of foolish souls and their envy.","Behold them that regard only the present, and cast away thoughts of evil to come from their minds.","How Bayazid cried out, when beside himself, Glory be to me!","and how his disciples were scandalized at this saying, and how Bayazid answered them.","Once that famous saint Bayazid came to his disciples, saying, Lo, I myself am God Almighty.","That man of spiritual gifts being visibly beside himself; Said, There is no God beside me; worship me!","Next morning, when his ecstatic state had passed, they said, You said so and so, which was impious.","He answered, If I do so again, straightway slay me with your knives!","God is independent of me; I am in the body.","If I say that again you must kill me!","When that holy person had given this injunction, each of his disciples made ready his knife.","Again that overflowing cup became beside himself, and his recent injunctions passed from his mind.","Alienation came upon him, reason went astray, the dawn shone forth and his lamp paled at its light.","Reason is like an officer when the king appears; The officer then loses his power and hides himself.","Reason is Gods shadow; God is the sun.","What power has the shadow before the sun?","When a man is possessed by an evil spirit the qualities of humanity are lost in him.","Whatever he says is really said by that spirit, though it seems to proceed from the mans mouth.","When the spirit has this rule and dominance over him, the agent is the property of the spirit, and not himself; His self is departed, and he has become the spirit.","The Turk without instruction speaks Arabic; When he returns to himself he knows not a word of it.","Seeing God is lord of spirits and of man, how can He be inferior in power to a spirit?","When the eagle of alienation from self took wing, bayazid began to utter similar speeches; The forrent of madness bore away his reason, and he spoke more impiously than before.","Within my vesture is naught but God, whether you seek Him on earth or in heaven.","His disciples all became mad with horror, and struck with their knives at his holy body.","Each one, like the assassins of Kardkoh, without fear aimed at the body of his chief.","Each who aimed at the body of the Shaikh, his stroke was reversed and wounded the striker.","No stroke took effect on that man of spiritual gifts, but the disciples were wounded and drowned in blood.","Each who had aimed a blow at his neck, saw his own throat cut, and gave up the ghost; He who had struck at his breast had cleft his own breast and killed himself.","They who knew better that lord of felicity, who had not courage enough to strike a deadly blow, their half-knowledge held their hands back; They saved their lives but slightly wounded themselves.","On the morrow those disciples, diminished in number, raised lamentations in their houses.","They went to Bayazid, thousands of men and women, saying, The two worlds are hidden in thy vesture; If this body of thine were that of a man, it would have perished of sword-wounds, like a mans.","The man in his senses fought with him beside himself, and thrust the thorn into his own eyes.","Ah!","you who smite with your sword him beside himself, you smite yourself therewith; Beware!","For he that is beside himself is annihilated and safe; Yea, he dwells in security forever.","His form is vanished, he is a mere mirror; Nothing is seen in him but the reflection of another.","If you spit at it, you spit at your own face, and if you hit that mirror, you hit yourself; And if you see an ugly face in it, tis your own, and if you see an Isa there, you are its mother Mary.","He is neither this nor that he is void of form; Tis your own form which is reflected back to you.","But when the discourse reaches this point, lip is closed; When pen reaches this point, it is split in twain.","Close then your lips, though eloquence be possible.","Keep silence; God knows the right way!","This is followed by an anecdote of the Prophet appointing an Hudhaili youth to be captain of a band of warriors amongst whom were many older and more experienced soldiers, and of the objections made to this appointment, and of the Prophets answer to the objectors.","Why the Prophet promoted the youth to command his seni the Prophet said, O ye who regard only the outside, regard him not as a youth void of talents.","Many are they whose beards are black yet are old, many too have white beards and hearts like pitch.","I have made trial of his wisdom often and often, and that youth has shown himself old in his actions.","Age consists in maturity of wisdom, O son, not, in whiteness of the beard and hair.","How can any one be older than Iblis?","Yet, if he has no wisdom, he is naught.","Suppose him an infant, if he has Isas soul, he is pure from pride and from carnal lust.","That whiteness of the hair is a sign of maturity only to purblind eyes whose vision is limited.","Since that shortsighted one judges by outward signs, he seeks the right course by outward tokens.","For his sake I said that if ye desire counsel ye ought to make choice of an old man.","He who has emerged from the veil of blind belief beholds by the light of God all things that exist.","His pure light, without signs or tokens, cleaves for him the rind and brings him to the kernel.","To the regarder of externals, genuine and base coin are alike.","How can he know what is inside the basket?","Many are the gold coins made black with smoke, so that they elude the clutches of greedy thieves; Many are the copper coins gilded with gold, and sold as gold to men of slender wits.","We who regard the inside of the world, we look at the heart and disregard the outside.","The judges who confine their view to externals and base their decisions on outward appearances, as they testify and make outward show of faith, are straightway dubbed faithful by men of externals.","Therefore these heretics, who regard only externals, have secretly shed the blood of many true believers.","Strive then to be old in wisdom and in faith, that, like Universal Reason, you may see within.","The wise man is he who possesses a forch of his own; He is the guide and leader of the caravan.","That leader is his own director and light; That illuminated one follows his own lead.","He is his own protector; do ye also seek protection from that light whereon his soul is nurtured.","The second, he, namely, who is half wise, knows the wise man to be the light of his eyes.","He clings to the wise man like a blind man to his guide, so as to become possessed of the wise mans sight.","But the fool, who has no particle of wisdom, has no wisdom of his own, and quits the wise man.","He knows nothing of the way, great or small, and is ashamed to follow the footsteps of the guide.","He wanders into the boundless desert, sometimes halting and despairing, sometimes running.","He has no lamp wherewith to light himself on his way, nor half a lamp which might recognize and seek light.","He lacks wisdom, so as to boast of being alive, and also half wisdom, so as to assume to be dead?","That half wise one became as one utterly dead in order to rise up out of his degradation.","If you lack perfect wisdom, make yourself as dead under the shadow of the wise, whose words give life.","The fool is neither alive so as to companion with Isa, nor yet dead so as to feel the power of Isas breath.","His blind soul wanders in every direction, and at last makes a spring, but springs not upwards.","The counsels of the bird.","A man captured a bird by wiles and snares; The bird said to him, O noble sir, in your time you have eaten many oxen and sheep, and likewise sacrificed many camels; You have never become satisfied with their meat, so you will not be satisfied with my flesh.","Let me go, that I may give you three counsels, whence you will see whether I am wise or foolish.","The first of my counsels shall be given on your wrist, the second on your well-plastered roof, and the third I will give you from the top of a tree.","On hearing all three you will deem yourself happy.","As regards the counsel on your wrist, tis this.","Believe not foolish assertions of any one!","When he had spoken this counsel on his wrist, he flew up to the top of the roof, entirely free.","Then he said, Do not grieve for what is past; When a thing is done, vex not yourself about it.","He continued, Hidden inside this body of mine is a precious pearl, ten drachms in weight.","That jewel of right, belonged to you, wealth for yourself and prosperity for your children.","You have lost it, as it, was not fated you should get it, that pearl whose like can nowhere be found.","Thereupon the man, like a woman in her travail, gave vent to lamentations and weeping.","The bird said to him, Did I not counsel you, saying, Beware of grieving over what is past and gone?","When tis past and gone, why sorrow for it?","Either you understood not my counsel or are deaf.","The second counsel I gave you was this, namely, Be not misguided enough to believe foolish assertions.","O fool, altogether I do not weigh three drachms, how can a pearl of ten drachms be within me?","The man recovered himself and said, Well then, tell me now your third good counsel!","The bird replied, You have made a fine use of the others, that I should waste my third counsel upon you.","To give counsel to a sleepy ignoramus is to sow seeds upon salt land.","Torn garments of folly and ignorance cannot be patched.","O counselors, waste not the seed of counsel on them!","Destroy your house, and with the treasure hidden in it you will be able to build thousands of houses.","The treasure lies under it; there is no help for it; Hesitate not to pull it down; do not tarry!","For with the coin of that treasure a thousand houses can be built without labor.","At last of a surety that house will be destroyed, and the divine treasure will be seen beneath it.","But twill not belong to you, because in truth that prize is the wages for destroying the house.","When one has not done the work he gets no wages; Man gets nothing he has not worked for.","Then you will bite your finger, saying, Alas!","That bright moon was hidden under a cloud.","I did not do what they told me for my good; Now house and treasure are lost and my hand is empty.","You have taken your house on lease or hired it; Tis not your own property to buy and sell.","As to the term of the lease, it is till your death; In that term you have to turn it to use.","If before the end of the term of the lease you omit to derive profit from the house, then the owner puts you out of it, and pulls it down himself to find the gold-mine.","While you are now smiting your head in deep regret, and now tearing your beard to think of your folly, saying, Alas!","that house belonged to me; I was blind and did not derive profit from it.","Alas!","the wind has carried off my dwelling forever!","O misery that rests on slaves!","In that house of mine I saw but forms and pictures; I was enchanted with that house so fleetin!","I was ignorant of the treasure hidden beneath it, otherwise I would have grasped an axe as a perfume.","Ah!","if I had administered the justice of the axe, i should now have been quit of sorrow.","But I fixed my gaze on outward forms, like an infant I sported with playthings.","Well said the famous Hakim Sanai, Thou art a child; thy house is full of pictures.","In his divine poem he gives this advice, Sweep away the dust from thy house!","They who recognize the almighty power of God do not ask where heaven is or where hell is.","O Pharaoh, if you are wise, I show you mercy; But if you are an ass, I give you the stick as an ass.","So I will drive you out of your stable, even as I make your head and ears bleed with my stick.","In this stable asses and men alike are deprived of peace by your oppressions.","See!","I have brought a staff for the purpose of correcting every ass who does not prove tractable.","It turns into a serpent in vengeance against you, because you have become a serpent in deed and character.","You are an evil serpent, swelled to the size of a hill.","Yet look at the Serpent (constellation) in heaven.","This staff is a foretaste to you of hell, saying, Ho, take refuge in the light!","Otherwise you will fall into my jaws, and will find no escape from my clutches!","This staff even now became a serpent, so that you need not ask, Where is Gods hell?","God makes a hell wheresover He wills; He makes the very sky a snare and trap for birds.","He produces pains and aches in your teeth, so that you say, Tis a hell and serpents bite.","Or again He makes your spittle as honey, so that you say, Tis heaven and wine of Paradise.","He makes sugar to grow in your mouth, that you may know the might of the divine decrees.","Therefore, bite not the innocent with your teeth; Bear in mind the divine stroke that tarries not.","God made the Nile blood to the Egyptians, he preserved the Israelites from the peril, that you might know how God discerns between the wise and the foolish wayfarers.","The Nile learned of God discernment when it let the ones through and engulphed the others.","Gods mercy made the Nile wise, his wrath made Cain foolish.","Of His mercy He created wisdom in inanimate things, and of His wrath He deprived the wise of wisdom.","Of His mercy wisdom accrued to inanimate things, as a chastisement He took wisdom from the wise.","Here at His command wisdom was shed down like whilst there wisdom saw His wrath and fled away.","Clouds and sun, and moon and lofty stars, all come and go in obedience to His ordinance; No one of them comes save at His appointed time; It lingers not behind nor anticipates that time.","Whereas you understood not this secret, the prophets have instilled this knowledge into stone and staff; So that you may infer that other inanimate things without doubt resemble in this stones and staves.","The obedience of stone and staff is shown to you, and informs you of that of other inanimate things.","They cry, We are all aware of God and obey Him; We are not destructive by mere fortuitous chance.","Thus you know the water of the Nile when in flood made distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.","You know the others are wise as earth, who, when cleft, knew Qarun and swallowed him up in vengeance.","Or like the moon, who heard the command and hasted to sever itself into two halves in the sky.","Or like the trees and stones, which in all places were seen to bow down at the feet of Mustafa.","The arguments between a Sunni and a Materialist (Dahri) decided by the arbitrament of fire.","Last night a Sunni said, The world is transitory; The heavens will pass away; God will be the heir.","A philosopher replied, How know you they are transitory?","How knows the rain the transitory nature of the cloud?","Are you not a mere mote floating in the sunbeams?","How know you that the sun is transitory?","A mere worm buried in a dung-heap, how can it know the origin and end of the earth?","In blind belief you have accepted this from your father, and through folly have clung to it ever since.","Tell me what is the proof of its transitoriness, or else be silent and indulge not in idle talk.","The Sunni said, One day I saw two persons engaged in argument on this deep question, yea, in dispute and controversy and argument.","At last a crowd was gathered round them.","I proceeded towards that company to inform myself of the subject of their discourse.","One said, This sky will pass away; Doubtless this building had a builder.","The other said, It is eternal and without period; It had no builder, or it was its own builder.","The first said, Do you then deny the Creator, the Bringer of day and night, the Sustainer of men?","He answered, Without proof I will not listen to what you say; tis only based on blind belief.","Go!","bring proof and evidence, for never will I accept this statement without proof he answered, The proof is within my heart, yea, my proofs are hidden in my heart.","From weakness of vision you see not the new moon; If I see it, be not angry with me!","Much talk followed, and the people were perplexed about the origin and end of the revolving heavens.","Then the first said, O friend, within me is a proof which assures me of the transitoriness of the heavens.","I hold it for certain, and the sign of certainty in him who possesses it is entering into fire.","Know this proof is not to be expressed in speech, any more than the feeling of love felt by lovers.","The secret I labor to express is not revealed save by the pallor and emaciation of my face.","When the tears course down my cheeks, they are a proof of the beauty and grace of my beloved.","The other said, I take not these for a proof, though they may be a proof to common people.","The Sunni said, When genuine and base coin boast, saying, Thou art false, I am good and genuine, Fire is the test ultimately, when the two rivals are cast into the furnace.","Accordingly both of them entered the furnace, both leapt into the fiery flame; And the philosopher was burnt to ashes, but the God-fearing Sunni was made fairer than before.","Moses said, O Lord of the day of account, thou makest forms; wherefore, then, destroyest Thou them?","Thou makest charming forms, both men and women; Wherefore, then, dost Thou lay them waste?","God answered, I know that this query of thine proceeds not from negation or vain curiosity.","Otherwise I should chastise and punish thee; Yea, I should rebuke thee for this question.","But thou seekest to discover in my actions the ruling principle and the eternal mystery, in order to inform the people thereof, and to make ripe every raw person.","Yea, O messenger, thou questionest me that I may reveal my ways to the people, though thou knowest them.","O Moses, go and sow seed in the ground in order to do justice to this question.","When Moses had sowed and his seed had grown up, he took a sickle and reaped the corn, and then a divine voice reached his ears: Why hast thou sown and nurtured the corn, and then cut it down directly it was ripe?","Moses replied, Lord, I cut it and lay it low because here I have grain and straw.","Grain is out of place in the straw-yard, and straw is useless in the wheat-barn.","Tis wrong to mix these two, it is needful to sift them one from the other.","God said, From whom learnest thou this knowledge whereby thou hast constructed a threshing-floor?","Moses said, O Lord, Thou hast given me discernment.","God said, Then have not I also discernment?","Amongst my creatures there are pure spirits, and also dark and befouled spirits.","The oyster-shells are not all of the same value; Some contain pearls, and others black stones.","It is needful to discern the bad from the good, just as much as to sift wheat from straw.","The people of this world exist in order to manifest and to disclose the hidden treasure.","Read, I was a hidden treasure, and desired to be known; Hide not the hidden treasure, but disclose it.","Your true treasure is hidden under a false one, just as butter is hidden within the substance of milk.","The false one is this transitory body of yours, the true one your divine soul.","Long time this milk is exposed to view, and the souls butter is hidden and of no account.","Stir up your milk assiduously with knowledge, so that what is hidden in it may be disclosed; Because this mortal is the guide to immortality, as the cries of revellers indicate the cup-bearer.","(Muhammad), and he who grieves him must expect trouble in the world.","The whole world is the outward form of Universal Reason, for it is the father of all creatures of reason.","When a man acts basely towards Universal Reason, its form, the world, shows its teeth at him.","Be loyal to this father and renounce disobedience, that this earthy house may furnish you golden carpets.","Then the judgment-day will be the cash of your state, Earth and heavens will be transfigured before you.","I am ever in concord with this father of ours, and earth ever appears to me as a Paradise.","Each moment a flesh form, a new beauty, so that weariness vanishes at these ever-fresh sights.","I see the world filled with blessings, fresh waters ever welling up from new fountains.","The sound of those waters reaches my ears, first he appeared in the class of inorganic things, next he passed therefrom into that of plants.","For years he lived as one of the plants, remembering naught of his inorganic state so different; And when he passed from the vegetive to the animal state he had no remembrance of his state as a plant, except the inclination he felt to the world of plants, especially at the time of spring and sweet flowers.","Like the inclination of infants towards their mothers, which know not the cause of their inclination to the breast, or the excessive inclination of young disciples towards their noble and illustrious teachers.","The disciples partial reason comes from that Reason, the disciples shadow is from that bough.","When the shadows in the disciples cease, they know the reason of their attachment to the teachers.","For, O fortunate one, how can the shadow move, unless the tree that casts the shadow move as well?","Again, the great Creator, as you know, drew man out of the animal into the human state.","Thus man passed from one order of nature to another, till he became wise and knowing and strong as he is now.","Of his first souls he has now no remembrance, and he will be again changed from his present soul.","In order to escape from his present soul full of lusts he must behold thousands of reasonable souls.","Though man fell asleep and forgot his previous states, yet God will not leave him in this self-forgetfulness; And then he will laugh at his own former state saying,  What mattered my experiences when asleep?","When I had forgotten my prosperous condition, and knew not that the grief and ills I experienced were the effect of sleep and illusion and fancy?","In like manner this world, which is only a dream.","Seems to the sleeper as a thing enduring for ever but when the morn of the last day shall dawn, the sleeper will escape from the cloud of illusion; Laughter will overpower him at his own fancied grieves when he beholds his abiding home and place.","Whatever you see in this sleep, both good and evil, will all be exposed to view on the resurrection day.","Whatever you have done during your sleep in the world will be displayed to you clearly when you awake.","Imagine not that these ill deeds of yours exist not in this sleep of yours, and will not be revealed to you.","But your present laughter will turn to weeping and woe on the day of revealing, O you who oppress captives!","Your present wailing and sorrow and grieves, on the other hand, will be joy when you awake, o you, who have rent the garments of many Josephs, you will rise from your heavy sleep as a wolf.","Your bad qualities will rise in the shape of wolves and rend you limb from limb in vengeance.","By the law of retaliation blood sleeps not after death; Say not, I shall die and obtain pardon.","The retaliation of this world is illusive, it is mere sport compared to the retaliation to come.","Therefore God calls the world a pastime and a sport, for punishment in this world is sport compared to that here punishment is as the repression of quarrels, there it is as castration or circumcision.","But this discourse is endless, O Moses, go and leave these asses to their grazing!","Let them fatten themselves with the food they love, for they are very wolves and objects of my wrath.","Zul Qarnain at Mount Qaf.","Zul Qarnain journeyed to Mount Qaf; He saw it was formed of a bright emerald, forming as it were a ring round the world, whereat all people are filled with wonder.","He said, Thou mighty hill, what are other hills?","Before thee they are mere playthings.","The Mount replied, Those hills are my veins, but they are not like me in beauty and importance.","A hidden vein from me runs to every city, the quarters of the world are bound to my veins.","When God desires an earthquake under any city, he bids me shake one of my veins.","Then in anger I shake that vein which is connected with that particular city.","When He says, Enough, my vein remains still, i remain still, and then haste to perform my work.","Now still like a plaster, and now operating; Now still like thought, and then speaking my thought.","But they who are void of reason imagine that these earthquakes proceed from earths vapors.","Just so an ant who saw a pen writing on paper, delivered himself to another ant in this way That pen is making very wonderful figures, like hyacinths and lilies and roses.","The other said, The finger is the real worker, the pen is only the instrument of its working.","A third ant said,  No; the action proceeds from the arm, the weak finger writes with the arms might.","So it went on upwards, till at last a prince of the ants, who had some wit said, Ye regard only the outward form of this marvel, which form becomes senseless in sleep and death.","Form is only as a dress or a staff in the hand, it is only from reason and mind these figures proceed.","But he knew not that this reason and mind would be but lifeless things without Gods impulsion.","The angel Gabriel appears to the Prophet Muhammad.","Mustafa said to the angel Gabriel, O friend, show me thy form as it really is; Show it to me openly and perceptibly, that I may behold thee with my eyes.","Gabriel said, Thou canst not do so, thou art too weak, thy senses are exceeding weak and frail.","Muhammad said, Show it, that this body of mine may see to what extent its senses are frail and impotent.","True, mans bodily senses are frail, but he possesses within him a mighty property.","This body resembles flint and steel, but like them it has the power of kindling fire.","Flint and steel are able to generate fire, from them springs fire which can destroy its parents.","As he continued importuning him, Gabriel displayed his awful form, whereat the mountains were rent asunder.","It occupied the sky from east to west.","And Mustafa swooned with fear.","When Gabriel beheld him swooning with fear, he came and clasped him in his arms.","Address to Husamu-d-Din.","O light of God, Husamu-d-Din, admit this asss head into that melon-garden!","For when this ass is killed in the slaughter-house that kitchen will bestow upon him a new existence.","From me proceeds the form, from thee the spirit; Nay, form and spirit both proceed from thee!","Thou art as Muhammad in heaven, O brilliant Sun!","Be also as Muhammad on earth forever and ever!","So that earth and heaven on high may be united with one heart, one worship, one aspiration!","And schism and polytheism and duality disappear, and Unity abide in the Real Spiritual Being!","When my spirit recognizes thy spirit, we remember our essential union and origin.","Outward acts bear witness of the state of the heart within.","Prayer and fasting and pilgrimage and holy war bear witness of the faith of the heart.","Giving alms and offerings and quitting avarice also bear witness of the secret thoughts.","So, a table spread for guests serves as a plain sign, saying, O guest, I am your sincere well-wisher.","So, offerings and presents and oblations bear witness, saying, I am well pleased with you.","Each of these men lavishes his wealth or pains, what means it but to say, I have a virtue within me, yea, a virtue of piety or liberality, whereof my oblations and fasting bear witness?","Fasting proclaims that he abstains from lawful food, and that therefore he doubtless avoids unlawful food.","And his alms say, He gives away his own goods; It is therefore plain that he does not rob others.","If he acts thus from fraud, his two witnesses (Fasting and alms) are rejected in Gods court; If the hunter scatters grain not out of mercy, but to catch game; If the cat keeps fast, and remains still in fasting only to entrap unwary birds; Making hundreds of people suspicious, and giving a bad name to men who fast and are liberal; Yet the grace of God, despite this fraud, may ultimately purge him from all this hypocrisy.","Mercy may prevail over vengeance, and give the hypocrite such light as is not possessed by the full moon.","God may purge his dealings from that hypocrisy, and in mercy wash him clean of that defilement.","In order that the pardoning grace of God may be seen, god pardons all sins that need pardon.","Wherefore God rains down water from the sign Pisces, to purify the impure from their impurities.","Thus acts and words are witnesses of the mind within, from these two deduce inferences as to the thoughts.","When your vision cannot penetrate within, inspect the water voided by the sick man.","Acts and words resemble the sick mans water, which serves as evidence to the physician of the body.","But the physician of the spirit penetrates the soul, and thence ascertains the mans faith.","Such an one needs not the evidence of fair acts and words Beware of such, they spy out the heart.","Require this evidence of act and word only from one who is not joined to the divine Ocean like a stream.","But the light of the traveler arrived at the goal, verily that light fills deserts and wastes.","That witness of his is exempt from bearing witness, and from all trouble and risk and good works.","Since the brilliance of that jewel beams forth, it is exempted from these obligations.","Wherefore require not from him act and word evidence, because both worlds through him bloom like roses.","What is this evidence but manifestation of hidden things, whether it be evidence in word, or deed, or otherwise?","Accidents serve only to manifest the secret essence; The essential quality abides, and accidents pass away.","This mark of gold endures not the touchstone, but only the gold itself, genuine and undoubted.","These prayers and holy war and fasting will not endure, only the noble soul endures.","The soul exhibits acts and words of this sort, then it rubs its substance on the touchstone of Gods command, saying, My faith is true, behold my witnesses!","But witnesses are open to suspicion.","Know that witnesses must be purified, and their purification is sincerity, on that you may depend.","The witness of word consists in speaking the truth, the witness of acts in keeping ones promises.","If the witness of word lie, its evidence is rejected, and if the witness of act play false, it is rejected.","Your words and acts must be without self-contradiction in order to be accepted without question.","Your aims are different, and you contradict yourselves, you sew by day, and tear to pieces by night.","How can God listen to such contradictory witness, unless He be pleased to decide on it in mercy?","Act and word manifest the secret thoughts and mind, both of them expose to view the veiled secret.","When your witnesses are purified they are accepted, otherwise they are arrested and kept in durance.","They enter into conflict with you, O stiff-necked one; Stand aloof and wait for them, for they too wait.","Prayers for spiritual enlightenment.","O God, who hast no peer, bestow Thy favor upon me; Since Thou hast with this discourse put a ring in my ear, take me by the ear, and draw me into that holy assembly where Thy saints in ecstasy drink of Thy pure wine!","Now that Thou hast caused me to smell its perfume, withhold not from me that musky wine, O Lord of faith of Thy bounty all partake, both men and women, thou art ungrudging in bounties, O Hearer of prayer.","Prayers are granted by Thee before they are uttered, thou openest the door to admit hearts every moment!","How many letters Thou writest with Thy Almighty pen!","Through marveling thereat stones become as wax.","Thou writest the Nun of the brow, the Sad of the eye, and the Jim of the ear, to amaze reason and sense.","These letters exercise and perplex reason; Write on, O skilful Fair-writer!","Imprinting every moment on Not-being the fair forms of the world of ideals, to confound all thought!","Yea, copying thereon the fair letters of the page of ideals, to wit, eye and brow and moustache and mole!","For me, I will be a lover of Not-being, not of existence, because the beloved of Not-being is more blessed.","God made reason a reader of all these letters, to suggest to it reflections on that outpouring of grace.","Reason, like Gabriel, learns day by day its daily portion from the Indelible Tablet.","Behold the letters written without hands on Not-being!","Behold the perplexity of mankind at those letters!","Every one is bewildered by these thoughts, and digs for hidden treasure in hope to find it.","This bewilderment of mankind as to their true aims is compared to the bewilderment of men in the dark looking in all directions for the Qibla, and recalls the text, O the misery that rests upon my servants.","There is no monkery in Islam.","Tear not thy plumage off it cannot be replaced; Disfigure not thy face in wantonness, O fair one!","That face which is bright as the forenoon sun, to disfigure it were a grievous sin.","Twere paganism to mar such a face as thine!","The moon itself would weep to lose sight of it!","Knowest thou not the beauty of thine own face?","Quit this temper that leads thee to war with thyself] It is the claws of thine own foolish thoughts that in spite wound the face of thy quiet soul.","Know such thoughts to be claws fraught with poison, which score deep wounds on the face of thy soul.","Rend not thy plumage off, but avert thy heart from it for hostility between them is the law of this holy war.","Were there no hostility, that war would be impossible.","Hadst thou no lust, obedience to the law could not be.","Hadst thou no concupiscence there could be no abstinence.","Where no antagonist, what need is there of armies?","Ah!","make not thyself an eunuch, not a monk, because chastity is mortgaged to lust.","Without lust denial of lust is impossible no man can display bravery against the dead.","God says, Expend; wherefore earn money.","Since expenditure is impossible without previous gain?","Although the passage contains only the word Expend, Read Acquire first, and then expend.","In like manner, when the King of kings says Abstain, It implies an object of desire wherefrom to abstain.","Again, Eat ye, is said recognising the snares of lust, and afterwards,  Exceed not, to enjoin temperance.","When there is no subject, the existence of a predicate is not possible.","When thou endurest not the pains of abstinence and fulfillest not the terms, thou gainest no reward.","How easy those terms!","how abundant that reward!","A reward that enchants the heart and charms the soul!","Prayers to God to change our base inclinations and give us higher aspirations.","Thou that changest earth into gold, and out of other earth madest the father of mankind, thy business is changing things and bestowing favors, my business is mistakes and forgetfulness and error.","Change my mistakes and forgetfulness to knowledge; I am altogether vile, make me temperate and meek.","O Thou that convertest salt earth into bread, and bread again into the life of men; Thou who madest the erring soul a guide to men, and him that erred from the way a prophet; Thou makest some earth-born men as heaven, and muitipliest heaven-born saints on earth!","But whoso seeks his water of life in worldly joys, to him comes death quicker than to the rest.","The eyes of the heart which behold the heavens see that the Almighty Alchemist is ever working here.","Mankind are ever being changed, and Gods elixir joins the bodys garment without aid of needle.","On the day that you entered upon existence, you were first fire, or earth, or air.","If you had continued in that, your original state, how could you have arrived at this dignity of humanity?","But through change your first existence remained not in lien thereof God gave you a better existence in like manner He will give you thousands of existences, one after another, the succeeding ones better than the former.","Regard your original state, not the mean states, for these mean states remove you from your origin.","As these mean states increase, union recedes; As they decrease, the unction of union increases.","From knowing means and causes holy bewilderment fails; Yea, the bewilderment that leads you to Gods presence.","You have obtained these existences after annihilations; Wherefore, then, do you shrink from annihilation?","What harm have these annihilations done you that you cling so to present existence, O simpleton?","Since the latter of your states were better than the former, seek annihilation and adore change of state.","You have already seen hundreds of resurrections occur every moment from your origin till now; One from the inorganic state to the vegetive state, from the vegetive state to the animal state of trial; Thence again to rationality and good discernment; Again you will rise from this world of sense and form.","Ah!","O crow, give up this life and live anew!","In view of Gods changes cast away your life!","Choose the new, give up the old, for each single present year is better than three past.","This is followed by a commentary on the saying of the prophet, Pity the pious man who falls into sin, and the rich man who falls into poverty, and the wise man who falls into the company of fools.","This is illustrated by an anecdote of a young deer who was placed in the asses stable, and jeered at and maltreated by them.","This suggests — Thus spake cursed Iblis to the Almighty, I want a mighty trap to catch human game withal.","God gave him gold and silver and troops of horses saying, You can catch my creatures with these.","Iblis said, Bravo!","but at the same time hung his lip, and frowned sourly like a bitter orange.","Then God offered gold and jewels from precious mines to that laggard in the faith, saying, Take these other traps, O cursed one.","But Iblis said, Give me more, O blessed Defender.","God gave him succulent and sweet and costly wines, and also store of silken garments.","But Iblis said,  O Lord, I want more aids than these, in order to bind men in my twisted rope so firmly that Thy adorers, who are valiant men may not, man-like, break my bonds asunder.","When at last God showed him the beauty of women, which bereaves men of reason and self-control, then Iblis clapped his hands and began to dance, saying, Give me these; I shall quickly prevail with these!","This is followed by comments on the text, Of goodliest fabric we created man, and then brought him down to the lowest of the low, saving those who believe and do the things that are right; and on the verses, If thou goest the road, they will show thee the road; If thou becomest naught, they will turn thee to being.","O Thou that givest aliment and power and stability, set free the people from their instability.","To the soul that is bent double by envy give uprightness in the path of duty, give them self-control, weigh down their scales, Release them from the arts of deceivers.","Redeem them from envying, O gracious One, that through envy they be not stoned like Iblis.","Even in their fleeting prosperity, see how the people burn up wealth and men through envy!","See the kings who lead forth their armies to slay their own people from envy!","Lovers of sweethearts have conceived jealousy, and attempted one anothers lives, read  Wais and Ramin and Khosrau and Shirin To see what these fools have done to one another.","Lovers and beloved have both perished; And not themselves only, but their love as well.","Tis God alone who agitates these nonentities making one nonentity fall in love with another.","In the heart that is no heart envy comes to a head, thus Being troubles nonentity.","When a friend tells a joke to his friend, the deaf man who listens laughs twice over; The first time from imitation and foolishness, because he sees all the party laughing; Yet, though he laughs like the others, he is then ignorant of the subject of their laughter; Then he inquires what the laughter was about, and, on hearing it, proceeds to laugh a second time.","Wherefore the blind imitator is like a deaf man, in regard to the joy he feigns to feel.","The light is the Shaikhs, the fountain the Shaikhs, and the outpouring of joy is also the Shaikhs, not his.","Tis like water in a vessel, or light through a glass; If they think they come from themselves, they are wron£ When the vessel leaves the fountain, it sees its error; It sees the water in it comes from the fountain.","The glass also learns, when the moon sets, that its light proceeded from the shining of the moon.","When his eyes are opened by the command, Arise!","Then that disciple smiles a second time, like the dawn.","He laughs also at his own previous laughter, which overtook him out of mere blind imitation.","When he returns from his long and distant wanderings he says, Lo!","this was the truth, this the secret!","With what blindness and misconception did I pretend.","To experience joy in that distant valley?","What a delusion I was under!","what a mistake!","My feeble wit conjured up vain imaginations.","How can an infant on the road know the thoughts of men?","How far its fancies are removed from true knowledge!","The thoughts of infants run on the nurse and milk, or on raisins or nuts, or on crying and wailing.","The blind imitator is like a feeble infant, even though he possesses fine arguments and proofs.","His preoccupation with obscure arguments and proofs drags him away from insight into truth.","His stock of lore, which is the salve of his eyes, bears him off and plunges him in difficult questions.","Ah!","man of imitation, come out of Bokhara!","And humble yourself in order to be exalted.","Then you will, behold another Bokhara within you, whereof the heroes ignore these questions of law.","Though a footman may be swift of foot on land, yet on the sea he is as one with ruptured tendons.","That footman is only carried by land, But he who is carried by sea is the truly learned one.","The King of kings showers special favors upon him; Know this, O man pledged to vain illusions!","The mere legal theologian is impotent to behold the light of the Spirit.","When the day dawns from heaven night flees away; What, then, can its darkness know of the nature of light?","The gnat scuds away before the blast of the winds; What, then, knows the gnat of the savor of the winds?","When the Eternal appears the transitory is annulled; What, then, knows he transitory of the Eternal?","When He sets foot on the transitory He bewilders it; When it is become naught He sheds his light upon it, if you wish, you can adduce hundreds of precedents, but I take no heed of them, O man poor in spirit!","The letters Lam, Mim, and Ha, Mim prefixed to some Suras resemble the staff of Moses, when fully understood.","Ordinary letters resemble these to outward view, but are far beneath them in signification.","If an ordinary man take a staff and try it, will it prove like the staff of Moses in the test?","This breath of Isa is not like every ordinary breath, which proceeds from mere human joy or sorrow.","These Alif, Mim, Ha and Mim, O father, proceed from the Lord of mankind.","If you have sense, regard not in the same way as these every ordinary Alif and Lam which resembles these; Although these sacred letters consist of common ones, and resemble common ones in their composition.","Muhammad himself was formed of flesh and skin, although no man is of the same genus as he.","He had flesh and skin and bones, although no man resembles him in composition; Because in his composition were contained divine powers, whereby all human flesh was confounded.","In like manner the composition of the letters Ha, Mim is far exalted above ordinary compounds of letters; Because from these mysterious compositions comes life, even as utter confusion follows the last trump.","That staff becomes a serpent and divides the Nile, like the staff of Ha, Mim, by the grace of God.","Its outward form resembles the outward forms of others, yet the disk of a cake differs much from the moons disk.","The saints weeping and laughter and speech are not his own, but proceed from God.","Whereas fools look only to outward appearances, these mysteries are totally hidden from them; Of necessity the real meaning is veiled from them, for the mystery is lost in the intervening medium.","Do not, like fools, crave mercy from the spear, but from the King in whose hand the spear is held.","Wherefore do you cry to spear and sword, seeing they are captives in the hand of that Noble One?","He is as Azar, maker of idols; I am only the idol; Whatever instrument He makes me, that I am.","If He makes of me a cup, a cup am I; If He makes of me a dagger, a dagger am I.","If He makes me a fountain, I pour forth water; If He makes me fire, I give forth heat.","If He makes me rain, I produce rich crops; If He makes me a dart, I pierce bodies.","If He makes me a snake, I dart forth poison; If He makes me a friend, I serve my friends.","I am as the pen in the fingers of the writer, i am not in a position to obey or not at will.","One said, The world would be a pleasant place if death never set foot within it.","Another answered, If there were no death, the complicated world would be worth not a jot.","It would be a crop raised in a desert, left neglected and never threshed out.","Thou fanciest that to be death, which is life, thou sowest thy seed in salt ground.","Carnal reason deceives us; do thou contradict it, for that fool takes what is really death to be life.","O God, show us all things in this house of deception, show them all as they really are!","It is said in the Hadis that on the last day the command, Arise, will come to every single body.","The blast of the last trump will be Gods command to every atom to lift its head from the earth.","The souls, also, of each will return to their bodies, even as sense returns to bodies awaking from sleep.","On that morn each soul will recognize its own body, and return to its own ruin like hidden treasure.","It will recognize its own body and enter it.","The soul of the goldsmith will not enter the tailor; The soul of the wise will enter the body of the wise, the soul of the unjust the body of the unjust.","In like manner as the souls will fly into their clay, so will the books fly into their right hands and left.","God will place in their hands their books of greed and liberality, of sin and piety, and whatever they have practiced.","When they shall awake from sleep on that morning, all the evil and good they have done will recur to them.","Every thought which has dwelt in them during life will appear as a form visible to all, like the thought of an architect realized in a house, or the perfect plant issuing from the seed in the ground.","From onion and saffron and poppy the hand of spring will unfold the secret of winter.","This one will be verdant and flourish, saying, We are the pious; That other will hang his head like the violet, with tears starting from his eyes through deadly fear; Yea, tens of founts of tears through terrible dread; With eyes wide opened in deadly apprehension lest his book may be placed in his left hand.","Then will the evildoer be sent to the fiery prison, for thorn can in no wise escape the flame.","When his guardian angels behind and before, who before were unseen, shall appear like patrols, they will hurry him off, pricking him with their spears, and saying, O dog, begone to thy kennel!","Then the prisoner will cry, O Lord, I am a hundred, yea, a hundred times as wicked as Thou sayest.","But in mercy Thou veilest my sins, otherwise my vileness were known to Thy all-seeing eye.","But, independently of my own works and warfare, independently of my faith or unfaith, good or evil, independently of my poor devotion to Thee, and of my thoughts and the thoughts of hundreds like me, i fix my hopes on Thy mercy alone.","Whether Thou adjudge me upright or rebellious, i sue for free pardon from Thy unbought justice.","Lord, who art gracious without thought of consequence, i set my face towards that free grace of Thine; I have no regard to my own acts.","I set my face towards this hope, seeing that Thou gayest me my being first of all; Thou gayest me the garment of being unasked, wherefore I firmly trust in Thy free grace.","When he thus enumerates his sins and faults, god at last will grant him pardon as a free gift, saying, O angels, bring him back to me, since the eyes of his heart were set on hope, without care for consequences I set him free, and draw the pen through the record of his sins!","A loved one said to her lover to try him, early one morning, O such an one, son of such an one, i marvel whether you hold me more dear, or yourself; tell me truly, O ardent suitor!","He answered, I am so entirely absorbed in you, that I am full of you from head to foot.","Of my own existence nothing but the name remains in my being is nothing besides you, O Object of desire!","Therefore am I thus lost in you, just as vinegar is absorbed in honey; Or as a stone, which is changed into a pure ruby, is filled with the bright light of the sun.","In that stone its own properties abide not it is filled with the suns properties altogether; So that, if afterwards it holds itself dear Tis the same as holding the sun dear, O beloved!","And if it hold the sun dear in its heart, Tis clearly the same as holding itself dear.","Whether that pure ruby hold itself dear, or hold the sun dear, there is no difference between the two preterences; On either hand is naught but the light of dawn.","But till that stone becomes a ruby it hates itself for till it becomes one I, it is two separate Ts, For tis then darkened and purblind, and darkness is the essential enemy of light.","If it then hold itself dear, it is an infidel; Because that self is an opponent of the mighty Sun.","Wherefore tis unlawful for the stone then to say I, because it is entirely in darkness and nothingness.","Pharaoh said, I am the Truth, and was laid low.","Mansur Hallaj said, I am the Truth, and escaped free.","Pharaohs I was followed by the curse of God; Mansurs I was followed by the mercy of God, O beloved!","Because Pharaoh was a stone, Mansur a ruby; Pharaoh an enemy of light, Mansur a friend.","O prattler, Mansurs I am He was a deep mystic saying, expressing union with the light, not mere incarnation.","On the resurrection day all secrets will be disclosed; Yea, every guilty one will be convicted by himself.","Hand and foot will bear testimony openly before the Almighty concerning their owners sins.","Hand will say, I stole such and such things; Lip will say, I asked for such and such things.","Foot will say, I went after my own desires; Arm will say, I embraced the harlot.","Eye will say, I looked after forbidden things; A man asked a camel, saying, Ho!","whence comest thou, thou beast of auspicious footstep?","He replied,  From the hot bath of thy street.","The man said,  That is proved false by thy dirty legs!","So, when stubborn Pharaoh saw Moses staff a serpent, and begged for a delay (to fetch magicians) and relented, wise men said, He ought to have become harsher, if He really be, as He says, the Lord Supreme.","What could miracles such as these of serpents, or even dragons, matter to the majesty of His divinity?","If He be really Lord Supreme, seated on His throne, what need has He to wheedle a worm like Moses?","O babbler, while thy soul is drunk with mere date wine, thy spirit hath not tasted the genuine grapes.","For the token of thy having seen that divine light is this, to withdraw thyself from the house of pride.","When a fowl flies to the salt water, it has never beheld the blessing of sweet water; But its faith is mere imitation of other fowl, and its soul has never seen the face of real faith.","Wherefore the blind imitator encounters great perils, perils of the road, of robbers, of cursed Satans.","But when he has seen the light of God, he is safe from the agitation of doubt, and is firm in the faith.","Till the foam has landed on the shore and dry land, which is its home, it is ever tossed to and fro.","Tis at home on the land, but a stranger on the water.","While it remains a stranger, it must be tossed about.","When its eyes are opened, and it sees the vision of land, satan has no longer any domination over it.","Although the ass repeated verities to the fox, he spoke them idly and in the way of cant.","He praised the water, but was not eager to drink; He rent his garments and his hair, but was no real lover.","The excuse of a hypocrite is rejected, not approved, because it comes only from the lips, not from the heart.","He has the scent of the apple, but not a piece of it, and the scent only for the purpose of misleading others.","Thus a womans onset in the midst of a battle array, she keeps in line, and forms part of the battle array, yet, though she looks a very lion as she stands in line, her hand begins to tremble as soon as she takes a sword.","Woe to him whose reason is like a woman while his lust is like a resolute man!","Of a certainty his reason will be worsted in the fight, and his imitation of a man will only lead him to ruin.","Happy is he whose reason is masculine, and his ugly lust feminine and under subjection!","Though the mere imitator quotes a hundred proofs, they are all based on opinion, not on conviction.","He is only scented with musk, he is not himself musk; He smells of musk, but is really naught but dung.","For his dung to become musk, O disciple, he must graze year after year in the divine pasture.","For he who, like the musk-deer, feeds on saffron of Khoten must not eat grass and oats like asses.","That man of cant has at his tongues end a hundred proofs and precepts, but there is no life in him.","When the preacher has himself no light or life, how can his words yield leaves and fruit?","He impudently preaches to others to walk aright, while himself He is unsteady as a reed shaken by wind.","Thus, though his preaching is very eloquent, it hides within it unsteadiness in the faith.","In order to gain true wisdom man must shake off worldly illusions.","The fox said, In my pure wine there are no dregs; These vain suspicions are not becoming.","All this is only baseless suspicion, O simple one, else you would know I am not plotting against you.","You repudiate me on account of your own bad fancies; Why do you thus suspect your true friends?","Think well of the Brothers of purity, Even though they show harshness toward you; For when evil suspicion takes hold of you, it severs you from hundreds of friends.","If a tender friend treats you roughly to try you, Tis contrary to reason to distrust him.","Though I bear a bad name, my nature is not malevolent; What you saw was not dangerous, it was only a talisman.","But even if there were danger in that object of suspicion, friends always pardon an offence.","This world of illusions, fancies, desires, and fears, is a mighty obstacle in the travelers path.","Thus, when these forms of delusive imaginations misled Abraham, who was a very mountain of wisdom, he said of the star,  This is my Lord, Having fallen into the midst of the world of illusion.","He thus interpreted the meaning of sun and stars, yea, he, that great man who threaded jewels of interpretation, seeing then that this world of eye-fascinating illusion seduced from the right path such a mountain as Abraham, so that he said of the star, This is my Lord, What will not its illusions effect on a stupid ass?","Human reason is drowned, like the high mountains, in the flood of illusion and vain imaginations.","The very mountains are overwhelmed by this flood, where is safety to be found save in Noahs ark?","By illusions that plunder the road of faith the faithful have been split into seventy-two sects.","But the man of conviction escapes illusion; He does not mistake his eyelash for the new moon.","He who is divorced from Omars light is deceived by his own crooked eyelash.","Thousands of ships, in all their majesty and pomp, have gone to pieces in this sea of illusion.","The monk said, I am searching everywhere for a man who lives by the life of the breath of God.","The other said, Here are men; the bazaar is full; These are surely men, O enlightened sage!","The monk said, I seek a man who walks straight as well in the road of anger as in that of lust.","Where is one who shows himself a man in anger and lust?","In search of such a one I run from street to street.","If there be one who is a true man in these two states, i will yield up my life for him this day!","The other, who was a fatalist, said, What you seek is rare.","But you are ignorant of the force of the divine decree; You see the branches, but ignore the root.","We men are but branches, Gods eternal decree the root.","That decree turns from its course the revolving sky, and makes foolish hundreds of planets like Mercury.","It reduces to helplessness the world of devices; It turns steel and stone to water.","you who attribute stability to these steps on the road, you are one of the raw ones; yea, raw, raw!","When you have seen the millstone turning round, then, prithee, go and see the stream that turns it.","When you have seen the dust rising up into the air, go and mark the air in the midst of the dust.","You see the kettles of thought boiling over, look with intelligence at the fire beneath them.","God said to Job, Out of my clemency i have given a grain of patience to every hair of thine.","Look not, then, so much at your own patience; After seeing patience, look to the Giver of patience.","How long will you confine your view to the waterwheel?","Lift up your head and view also the water.","Love is a perfect muzzle of evil suggestions; Without love who ever succeeded in stopping them?","Be a lover, and seek that fair Beauty, hunt for that Waterfowl in every stream!","How can you get water from that which cuts it off?","How gain understanding from what destroys understanding?","Apart from principles of reason are other principles of light and great price to be gained by love of God.","Besides this reason of yours God has other reasons which will procure for you heavenly nourishment.","By your carnal reason you may procure earthly food, by God-given reason you may mount the heavens.","When, to win enduring love of God, you sacrifice reason, god gives you a tenfold recompense; yea, seven hundred fold.","When those Egyptian women sacrificed their reason, they penetrated the mansion of Josephs love; The Cup-bearer of life bore away their reason, they were filled with wisdom of the world without end.","Josephs beauty was only an offshoot of Gods beauty; Be lost, then, in Gods beauty more than those women.","Love of God cuts short reasoning, O beloved, for it is a present refuge from perplexities.","Through love bewilderment befalls the power of speech, it no longer dares to utter what passes; For if it sets forth an answer, it fears greatly that its secret treasure may escape its lips.","Therefore it closes lips from saying good or bad, so that its treasure may not escape it.","In like manner the Prophets companions tell us When the Prophet used to tell us deep sayings, that chosen one, while scattering pearls of speech, would bid us preserve perfect quiet and silence.","So, when the mighty phoenix hovers over your head, causing your soul to tremble at the motion of its wings, you venture not to stir from your place, lest that bird of good fortune should take wing.","You hold your breath and repress your coughs, so as not to scare that phoenix into flying away.","And if one say a word to you, whether good or bad, you place finger on lip, as much as to say, Be silent.","That phoenix is bewilderment, it makes you silent; The kettle is silent, though it is boiling all the while.","His brain is dried up; and as for his reason, it is now less than that of a child.","Age and abstinence have added infirmity to infirmity, and his abstinence has yielded him no rejoicing.","He has endured toils, but gained no reward from his Friend; He has done the work, but has not been paid.","Either his work has lacked value, or the time of recompense is not decreed as yet.","Either his works are as the works of the Jews, or his reward is held back till the appointed time.","This grief and sorrow are enough for him, that in this valley of pain he is utterly friendless.","With sad eyes he sits in his corner, with frowning face and downcast looks.","There is no oculist who cares to open his eyes, nor has he reason enough to discover the eye-salve.","He strives earnestly with firm resolve and in hope, his work is done on the chance of being right.","The vision of The Friend is far from his course, for he loses the kernel in his love for the shell.","O Ayaz, what is this love of yours for your old shoes, which resembles the love of a lover for his mistress?","You have made these old shoes your object of devotion, just as Majnun made an idol of his Laila!","You have bound the affection of your soul to them, and hung them up in your secret chamber.","How long will you say orisons to this old pair of shoes?","And breathe your oft-told secrets into inanimate ears?","Like the Arab lover to the house of his dead mistress, you address to them long invocations of love.","Of what great Asaf were your shoes the house?","Is your old garment, think you, the coat of Yusuf?","Like a Christian who confesses to a priest his past years sins of fornication, fraud, and deceit; In order that the priest may absolve him of those sins; He thinks the priests absolution the same as Gods!","That priest is unable to condemn or to absolve; But faith and love are a mighty enchantment!","Gods dealings visible to the spiritual.","The wine is from that world, the vessels from this; The vessels are seen, but the wine is hidden!","Hidden indeed from the sight of the carnal, but open and manifest to the spiritual!","O God, our eyes are blinded!","O pardon us, our sins are a heavy burden!","Thou art hidden from us, though the heavens are filled with Thy light, which is brighter than sun and moon!","Thou art hidden, yet revealest our hidden secrets!","Thou art the source that causes our rivers to flow.","Thou art hidden in Thy essence, but seen by Thy bounties.","Thou art like the water, and we like the millstone.","Thou art like the wind, and we like the dust; The wind is unseen, but the dust is seen by all.","Thou art the spring, and we the sweet green garden; Spring is not seen, though its gifts are seen.","Thou art as the soul, we as hand and foot; Soul instructs hand and foot to hold and take.","Thou art as reason, we like the tongue; Tis reason that teaches the tongue to speak.","Thou art as joy, and we are laughing; The laughter is the consequence of the joy.","Our every motion every moment testifies, for it proves the presence of the Everlasting God.","So the revolution of the millstone, so violent, testifies to the existence of a stream of water.","O Thou who art above our conceptions and descriptions, dust be on our heads, and upon our similitudes of Thee!","Yet Thy slaves never cease devising images of Thee; They cry to Thee always, My life is Thy footstool!","Like that shepherd who cried, O Lord!","Come nigh to thy faithful shepherd, that he may cleanse thy garment of vermin, and mend thy shoes, and kiss the hem of thy robe!","No one equaled that shepherd in love and devotion, though his manner of expressing it was most faulty.","His love pitched its tent on the heavens, he himself was as the dog at the tent-door.","When the sea of love to God boiled up, it touched his heart, but it touches your ears only.","I said, O foul and faithless passion, whence have you derived this inclination to war?","Tell me truly, O passion, is this your trickery?","Or else is it stubbornness shunning obedience to God?","If you say not truly I will attack you, and will afflict you more severely with discipline.","Passion then heaved a cry from its breast, and without mouth vented the following complaints: In this cell you slay me every day; You slay my life like the life of a Gueber.","Not a soul is aware of my condition; You drag me along without food or sleep.","In the fight with one wound I shall quit the body, and the people will admire my valor and self-devotion.","I said, O bad passion, you live as an infidel, and as an infidel you will die; shame be upon you!","In both worlds you are naught but a hypocrite; In the two worlds only an unprofitable servant.","I have vowed to God never to quit this cell while life remains in this body; Because whatever the body does in this privacy is not done to make a fair show before men.","Its movements and its rest in the privacy of this cell are not intended for the sight of any besides God.","This is the greater warfare, that the lesser; Both these warfares have their Rustams and Haidars.","They are not to be fought by one whose reason and sense flee away as soon as a mouse wags its tail.","Such persons must shun the array of battle, and keep aloof from it even as women do.","A person put this question to a philosopher, O sage, what is true and what is false?","The sage touched his ear and said, This is false, but the eye is true and its report is certain.","The ear is false in relation to the eye, and most assertions are related to the ear.","If a bat turn away its eyes from the sun, still it is not veiled from some idea of the sun; Its very dread of the sun frames an idea of the sun, and that idea scares it away to the darkness.","That idea of light terrifies it, and makes it cling to the murky night.","Just so tis your idea of your terrible foe which makes you cling to your friends and allies.","O Moses, thy revelations shed glory on the mount, but that frightened one endured not thy realities.","Be not too proud, but know that you must first endure the idea of the Truth, and thence come to the reality.","No one is frightened by the mere idea of fighting, for no courage is needed before fighting begins.","In the mere idea of fighting a coward can imagine himself as attacking and retreating like Rustam.","The pictures of Rustam on the wall of a bath are similar to a cowards ideas of fighting.","But when these ideas are tested by actual sight, what of the coward then?","His bravery is gone!","Strive, then, from mere hearing to press on to seeing; What ear has told you falsely eye will tell truly.","Then ear too will acquire the properties of an eye; Your ears, now worthless as wool, will become gems; Yea, your whole body will become a mirror, it will be as an eye or a bright gem in your bosom.","First the hearing of the ear enables you to form ideas, then these ideas guide you to the Beloved.","Strive, then, to increase the number of these ideas, that they may guide you, like Majnun, to the Beloved.","Concerning the unbelievers who say, There is only this our present life; we live and we die, and naught but time destroyeth us."," To return; that prince played the fool, and took delight in the society of the damsel.","O prince, suppose your dominion extend from east to west, yet, as it endures not, esteem it transitory as lightning yea, O sleeping heart, know the kingdom that endures not forever and ever is only a mere dream.","I marvel how long you will indulge in vain illusion, which has seized you by the throat like a headsman.","Know that even in this world there is a place of refuge; Hearken not to the unbeliever who denies it.","His argument is this: he says again and again, If there were aught beyond this life we should see it.","But if the child sees not the state of reason, does the man of reason therefore forsake reason?","And if the man of reason sees not the state of love, is the blessed moon of love thereby eclipsed?","The beauty of Joseph was not visible to his brethren; Was it therefore hidden from the eyes of Jacob?","The eyes of Moses regarded his staff as a stick, but the divine eye saw it to be a deadly serpent.","The eye of the head was at issue with the divine eye, but the latter prevailed and gave convincing proof.","To the eyes of Moses his hand looked a mere hand, but to the divine eye it appeared a flashing light.","This subject in its entirety is endless, but to the unbeliever it is a mere fanciful idea.","The only realities to him are lust and gluttony; Speak not then to him of the mysteries of the Beloved.","To us believers lust and gluttony are only ideas, therefore we behold always the beauty of the Beloved.","To all men whose creed is lust and gluttony, applies the text, To you be your creed, to me mine.","In the face of negations like these cut short speech, O Ahmad, say little to an old Fire-worshipper!","We distribute among them,  to some carnal lusts, and to others angelic qualities.","If the prince lacked the animal manliness of asses, yet he possessed the true manliness of the prophets.","He renounced lust and anger and concupiscence, and showed himself a man of the lineage of the prophets.","Grant that he lacked the virility of asses, yet God esteemed him a lord of lords.","Let me be dead, so long as God regards me with favor!","I am better off than the living who are rejected of God; The former is the kernel of manliness, the latter only the rind; The former is borne to Paradise, the latter to hell.","The Prophet says, Paradise is annexed to tribulation, but hell-fire follows indulgence in lust.","O Ayaz, who slayest demons like a male lion, manliness of asses is naught, manliness of mind much.","What sort of man dost thou think him who sports as a boy, but who has no comprehension of these chief matters?","o thou who hast seen the delight of my connnandments, and risked thy life to perform them faithfully, hear a tale of the sweetness of my commandments, that the meaning of this sweetness may be made plain.","O LIFE of the heart, Husamu-d-Din, my zeal burnt within me to write this sixth part!","The Masnavi became a standard through thy influence, thy sword (Husam) has made it an exemplar to the world o spiritual one, I now offer it to thee, this sixth part of the entire Masnavi.","Enlighten the worlds six sides with its six parts, that it may illuminate him who is not illuminated!","Love has naught to do with five senses or six sides, its only aim is to be attracted to the Beloved!","But haply leave may be given me hereafter to tell those mysteries so far as they can be told, in a discourse more closely approximating to the facts than these faint indications of those abstruse matters.","Mysteries are not communicable, save to those who know; Mystery in the ear of infidels is no mystery.","Nevertheless, this is a call to you from God; It matters not to Him whether ye accept or reject it.","Noah repeated His call for nine hundred years, but his people only increased in rebellion.","Never did he draw back from admonishing them, never did he retire into the cave of silence.","He said, At the barking and howling of the dogs no caravan ever turned back in its road.","Nor does the full moon on a bright night cease shining because of the howling of dogs on earth.","The moon sheds her light, and the dogs howl; Every one acts according to his nature.","To each one his office is allotted by the divine decree, and he acts agreeably to his nature.","Art thou thirsting for the Ocean of spirituality?","Disport thyself on this island of the Masnavi!","Disport thyself so long as thou seest every moment spiritual verities revealed in this Masnavi.","When the wind blows the grass off the water, the water then shows forth its own purity.","Behold the bright and fresh sprays of coral, and the princely fruits growing in the water of life!","So, when the Masnavi is purged of letters and words, it drops all these, and appears as the sea of Unity.","Then speaker and hearer and spoken words all three give up the ghost in that consummation.","Bread-giver and bread-eater and bread itself are purified of their forms and turn to dust.","But their essences in each of these three grades are distinguished, as in those states, so eternally.","Their form turns to dust, but their essence not; If one says it does, tell him it does not.","In the world of spirits all three await judgment, sometimes wearing their earthly forms, sometimes not.","The worth of a man depends on the objects of his aspiration.","One day a student asked a preacher, saying, O most orthodox ornament of the pulpit, i have a question to ask, O lord of learning; Tell me the answer to it in this congregation.","A bird sat on the top of a wall; Which was best, its head or its tail?","He replied, If its face was towards the town, and its tail to the villages, then its face was best.","But if its tail was towards the town, and its face towards the villages, then prefer its tail to its face.","A bird flies with its wings towards its nest, the wings of a man are his aspiration and aim.","If a lover be befouled with good and evil, yet regard not these; regard rather his aspiration.","Though a falcon be all white and unmatched in form, if he hunts mice he is contemptible and worthless.","And if an owl fixes his affection on the king, he is a falcon in reality; regard not his outward form.","Adams clay was kneaded in the limits of a trough, yet was he exalted above heaven and stars.","We have honored Adam was not addressed to the sky, but to Adam himself full of defects as he was.","Did one ever propose to earth or heaven to receive beauty, reason, speech and aspiration?","Would you ever offer to the heavens beauty of face and acuteness of thought?","O son, did you ever present your silver body as an offering to the damsels pictured on bath walls?","Nay, you pass by those pictures though fair as Huris, and offer yourself sooner to half-blind old women.","What is there in the old women which the pictures lack, which draws you from the pictures to the old women?","Say not, for I will say it in plain words, Tis reason, sense, perception, thought, and life.","In the old woman life is infused, while the pictures of the bath have no life.","If the pictures of the bath should stir with life (soul), they would uproot your love to all the old women.","What is soul?","Tis acquainted with good and evil, rejoicing at pleasant things, grieving at His.","Since, then, the principle of soul is knowledge, he who knows most is most full of soul.","Knowledge is the effect flowing from soul; He who has most of it is most godlike.","Seeing then, beloved, that knowledge is the mark of soul, he who knows most has the strongest soul.","The world of souls is itself entirely knowledge, and he who is void of knowledge is void of soul.","When knowledge is lacking in a man s nature, his soul is like a stone on the plain.","Primal Soul is the theatre of Gods court, soul of souls the exhibition of God Himself.","All the angels were pure reason and soul, yet when the new soul of Adam came, they were as its body.","When in joy they crowded round that new soul, they bowed before it as body does before soul.","Fear of mens censure the greatest obstacle to acceptance of the true faith.","O Husamu-d-Din, I might tell some of thy many virtues, were it not for the fear of the evil eyes.","From evil eyes and malice-empoisoned breaths already have I suffered fatal wounds.","Therefore I cannot relate thy ecstatic states, save by hints of the ecstatic states of others.","This manoeuvre is one of the devices of the heart, whereby the hearts feet wend their way to the truth.","Many hearts and souls would become lovers of God did not evil eyes or evil ears hold them back.","Of these Abu Talib, the Prophets uncle, was one; The malice of the Arabs scared him from the faith.","He said, What will the Arabs say of me?","That my own nephew has perverted me from my religion!","Muhammad said, O uncle, confess the faith to me, that I may strive with God for thee!","He said, Nay; it will be published by them that hear; A secret known to more than two is known to every one.","As I live in the midst of these Arabs, it will cause me to lose caste with them.","Yet, had the mighty grace of God led the way, how could this fear have vied with Gods attraction?","O Granter of aid, lend us aid in this dilemma of the feeble will.","Prayers for right guidance in the use of free will, which gift was refused by heavens and earth, but accepted by man to his own.","This flux and reflux of resolves came to me from Thee, else these tides of will had rested still, O God!","By the same fiat whereby Thou madest me thus irresolute, of Thy mercy deliver me from this irresolution!","Thou triest me; O give me aid!","For men are as women through this trial.","How long, O Lord, is this trial to last?","Give me one ruling principle, not ten principles!","The whole world flees away from its own will and being towards self-abandonment and intoxication.","In order to escape a while from self-consciousness, men incur the reproach of wine and strong drink; For all know well this existence is a snare, this thought and memory and will only a hell.","Therefore they flee from self to being beside themselves, call it intoxication or call it preoccupation, O guided one.","Ere it is annihilated, no single soul finds admittance to the divine hall of audience.","What is ascension to heaven?","Annihilation of self; Self-abandonment is the creed and religion of lovers.","When he had eaten the grain he was caught in the trap, and began to recite the chapters Yasin and An am.","Then he began to wail and cry loudly, so that the very fowler and his trap shook with grief.","He said, My back is broken by the conflict of my thoughts; Beloved One, come and stroke my head in mercy!","The palm of Thy hand on my head gives me rest, thy hand is a sign of Thy bounteous providence.","Remove not Thy shadow from my head, i am afflicted, afflicted, afflicted!","Sleep has deserted my eyes through my longing for Thee, O Envy of cypresses!","Though I be unworthy of Thy favor, how were it if thou shouldst regard the grieves of unworthy me?","What claim of right can a non-existent thing make to have the doors of Thy bounty opened to it?","Yet Thy bounty had regard to my senseless dust and endued it with the ten jewels of the senses five external senses and five internal senses, whereby inanimate seed became a living man.","O Light on high!","what is repentance without Thy grace but a mere mockery of the beard of repentance; Thou rootest up the hairs of such repentance, repentance is the shadow, Thou the shining Moon.","Alas!","Thou hast ruined my house and home; How can I cease wailing while Thou oppressest me?","How can I flee away when there is no living away?","Without Thy sustaining lordship there is no slave.","take my life, Thou that art the source of life!","For apart from Thee I am wearied of my life.","I am a lover well versed in lovers madness, i am weary of learning and sense.","Since my bashfulness is destroyed, I will publish secrets; How long must I bear this trepidation and anxiety?","Formerly I was covered by modesty as by a veil, now I will leap from it under Thy coverlet!","O comrades, our Beloved has closed up all paths; We are as lame deer, and He as a raging lion.","Say what remedy is there but resignation when one is fallen into the hands of the raging lion?","The poet then passes on to the subject of the need for constant watchfulness, in order to avoid the snares of the world, and not to miss the divine blessing whenever it may appear.","There is a tradition, When half the night has passed Allah will descend to earth, and cry, Ho, ye that ask, it shall be answered to you; and ye that crave pardon, it shall be pardoned to you; and ye that petition, your petitions shall be granted.","But all who sleep the sleep of negligence will miss the promised blessing.","This is illustrated by the story of a lover who obtained an assignation with his mistress, but when she came, was found asleep, and was accordingly rejected.","I know not if thou art a moon or an idol, i know not what thou requirest of me.","I know not what service to pay thee, whether to keep silence or to speak.","Thou art not apart from me, yet, strange to say, i know not where I am, or where thou art.","I know not wherefore thou art dragging me, now embracing me, and now wounding me!","That wine of God is gained from that minstrel, this bodily wine from this minstrel.","Both of these have one and the same name in speech, but the difference between their worth is great.","Mens bodies are like pitchers with closed mouths; Beware, till you see what is inside them.","The pitcher of this body holds the water of life, whilst that one holds deadly poison.","If you look at the contents you are wise; If you look only at the vessel you are misguided.","Know words resemble these bodies, and the meaning resembles the soul.","The bodys eyes are ever intent on bodies, the souls eyes on the reasonable soul; Wherefore, in the figures of the words of the Masnavi, the form misleads, but the inner meaning guides.","In the Koran it is declared that its parables Mislead some and guide some.","O God!","when a spiritual man talks of wine, how can a fellow spiritual man mistake his meaning?","Thus that minstrel began his intoxicating song, O give me Thy cup, Thou whom I see not!","Thou art my face; what wonder if I see it not?","Extreme nearness acts as an obscuring veil.","Thou art my reason; what wonder if I see Thee not through the multitude of intervening obstacles?","Thou art nearer to me than my neck vein, How can I call to Thee, Ho, as if thou wert far off?","Nay, but I will mislead some by calling in the desert, to hide my Beloved from those of whom I am jealous!","You have said your say; now hear my answer, so as not to remain in astonishment and bewilderment.","Though to you this time seems midnight, to me the dawn of joyful morn seems nigh.","To the vulgar all parts of the world seem dead, but to God they are instinct with sense and love.","And as to your saying that this house is empty, why then should I beat a drum before it?","Know that the people of God expend money, and build many mosques and holy places, and spend health and wealth in distant pilgrimages, in ecstatic delight, like intoxicated lovers; And none of them ever say, The Kaba is empty; How can one who knows the truth say that?","These people are ranged in battle array, and risk their lives to gain Gods favor; One plunged in calamities like Job himself, another exhibiting patience like Jacob.","Thousands of them are thirsty and afflicted, striving in earnest desire to do Gods will.","I likewise, in order to please the merciful God, beat my drum at every door in hope of dawn.","Seek ye a purchaser who will pay you gold; Where will you find one more liberal than God?","He buys the worthless rubbish which is your wealth, he pays you the light that illumines your heart.","He accepts these frozen and lifeless bodies of yours, and gives you a kingdom beyond what you dream of.","He takes a few drops of your tears, and gives you the divine fount sweeter than sugar.","He takes your sighs fraught with grief and sadness, and for each sigh gives rank in heaven as interest.","In return for the sigh-wind that raised tear-clouds, god gave Abraham the title of Father of the faithful.","Come!","in this incomparable and crowded mart sell your old goods and take a kingdom in payment!","Since you have told the story of Hilal (the new moon) Now set forth the story of Badr (the full moon).","That new moon and that full moon are now united, removed from duality and defect and shortcomings.","That Hilal is now exalted above inward defect; His outward defects served as degrees of ascension.","Night after night that mentor taught him grades of ascent and through his patient waiting gave him happiness.","The mentor says, O raw hastener, through patient waiting, you must climb to the summit step by step.","Boil your pot by degrees and in a masterly way; Food boiled in mad haste is spoiled.","Doubtless God could have created the universe by the fiat Be!","in one moment of time; Why, then, did He protract His work over six days, each of which equaled a thousand years, O disciple?","Why does the formation of an infant take nine months?","Because Gods method is to work by slow degrees, why did the formation of Adam take forty days?","Because his clay was kneaded by slow degrees.","Not hurrying on like you, O raw one, who claim to be a Shaikh whilst yet only a child!","You run up like a gourd higher than all plants, but where is your power of resistance or combat?","You have leant on trees or on walls, and so mounted up like a gourd, O little dog rose; Even though your prop may be a lofty cypress, the dead regret not dying, but having lost opportunities in life.","Well said that Leader of mankind, that whosoever passes away from the world does not grieve and lament over his death, but grieves ever over lost opportunities.","He says, Why did I not keep death always in view, which is the treasury of wealth and sustenance?","Why did I blindly all my life set my affections on vain shadows which perish at death?","My regret is not that I have died, but that I rested on these vain shadows in life.","I saw not that my body was a mere shadow or foam, which foam rises out of and lives on the Ocean (God).","When the Ocean casts its foam-drops to land, go to the graveyard and behold them, and ask them, Where is your motion and activity?","The Ocean has cast you into a mortal sickness!","They will answer by their condition, if not with words, Put this question to the Ocean, not to us!","How can mere foam move unless moved by the waves?","How can dust mount on high unless raised by wind?","When you see the dust-cloud, see the wind too!","When you see the foam, see the ocean that heaves it!","Ah!","look till you see your own real final cause, the rest of you is only fat and flesh, warp and woof.","Your fat kindles no light or flame in a lamp; Your kneaded flesh is not good for roasting.","Burn up, then, all this body of yours with discernment; Rise to sight, to sight, to sight!","Virtue cannot exist without temptation and difficulties to be overcome.","The Sufi said, The Great Helper is able to procure for us profit without loss.","He who casts into the fire roses and trees can accomplish good without injury to any.","He who extracts the rose from the thorn can also turn this winter into spring.","He who exalts the heads of the cypresses is able also out of sadness to bring joy.","He by whose fiat all non-existent things exist, what harm to Him were it if He made them eternal?","He who gave to the body a soul and made it live, what loss to Him were it if He never caused it to die?","How would it be if That Liberal One were to give their hearts desire to his slaves without toil, and keep away from these feeble ones the ambushed snares of lust and temptations of Iblis?","The Qazi said, If there were no bitter things, and no opposition of fair and foul, stone and pearl, and no lust or Satan or concupiscence, and no wounds or war or fraud, pray, O destroyer of virtue, by what name and title could the King of kings address His slaves?","How could He say, O temperate or O meek one!","Or, O courageous one, or O wise one?","How could there be temperate, gentle, or liberal men if there were no cursed Satan to tempt them astray?","Rustam and Hamza would be all the same as cowards; Wisdom and knowledge would be useless and vain.","Wisdom and knowledge serve to guide the wanderers; Were there but one road wisdom would be needless.","To pamper the house of your body fleeting as water, do you think it right to ruin both worlds?","I know you are pure of guile and ripe, and ask this only to edify the ignorant.","The ills of fortune and all troubles soever are better than exile from God and neglect of Him; For the former pass away, but the latter abide; He is happy who carries a wary heart before God.","Inquire now, I pray, of each one of your members; These dumb members have a thousand tongues.","Inquire the detail of the bounties of the All-sustainer, which are recorded in the volume of the universe.","Day and night you are eagerly asking for news, whilst every member of your body is telling you news.","Since each member of your body issued from Not-being, how much pleasure has it seen, and how much pain?","For no member grows and flourishes without pleasure, and each member is weakened by every pain.","The member endures, but that pleasure is forgotten, yet not all forgotten, but hidden from the senses.","Like summer wherein cotton is produced, the cotton remains, but the summer is forgotten.","Or like ice which is formed in great frost, the frost departs, but the ice is still before us.","The ice is mindful of that extreme cold, and even in winter that crop is mindful of the summer.","In like manner, O son, every member of your body tells you tales of Gods bounties to your body.","Even as a woman who has borne twenty children, each child tells a tale of pleasure felt by her.","She became not pregnant save after sexual pleasure, can a garden bloom without the spring?","Pregnant women and their teeming wombs tell tales of love frolics in the spring.","So every tree which nurtures its fruits has been, like Mary, impregnated by the Unseen King.","Though fires heat be hidden in the midst of water, yet a thousand boiling bubbles prove it present.","Though the heat of the fire be working unseen, yet its bubbles signify its presence plainly.","In like manner, the members of those enjoying union Become big with child, viz., with forms of states and words.","Gazing on the beauty of these forms they stand agape, and the forms of the world vanish from their sight.","These spiritual progenies are not born of the elements, and are perforce invisible to the sensual eye.","These progenies are born of divine apparitions, and are therefore bidden by veils without color.","I said born, but in reality they are not born; I used this expression only by way of indication.","But keep silence till the King bids you speak, offer not your nightingale songs to these roses; For they themselves are saying to you in loud tones, O nightingale, hold your peace, and listen to us!","Those two kinds of fair forms (ecstatic states and words) Are undeniable proofs of a previous union; Yea, those two kinds of exalted manifestations are the evident fruits of a preceding wedlock.","The ecstasy is past, but your members recall it; Ask them about it, or call it to mind yourself.","When sorrow seizes you, if you are wise, you will question that sorrow-fraught moment, saying to it, O sorrow, who now deniest thy portion of bounty given thee by the Perfect One, even if each moment be not to thee a glad spring, yet of what is thy body, like a rose-heap, a storehouse?","Thy body is a heap of roses, thy thought rosewater; Twere strange if rosewater ignored the rose-heap!","This sad Faqir too put up his cries for aid, and bore off the ball of acceptance from the field.","But at times he distrusted the efficacy of his prayers, on account of the delay in answering them.","Again, hope of the mercy of the Lord arose in his heart as an earnest of rejoicing.","When he was hopeless and ceasing to pray in weariness he heard from God the word Ascend!","God is an Abaser and an Exalter without these two processes nothing comes into being.","Behold the abasement of earth and uplifting of heaven; Without these two heaven would not revolve, O man!","The abasement and exaltation of earth is otherwise, half the year is barren, half green and verdant.","The abasement and exaltation of weary time is otherwise again, half day and half night.","The abasement and exaltation of this compound body is now health and now grievous sickness.","Know all the conditions of the world are in this wise, drought, famine, peace, war, and trials.","This world flies, as it were, with these two wings; Through these all souls are homes of hope and fear; So that the world keeps trembling like leaves, in the cold and hot winds of death and resurrection.","Till tbe jar of pure wine of our Isa (Unity) Shall supersede the jar of many-colored wine (plurality), for that world (of unity) is as a saltpan; Whatever enters it loses its varied hues.","Whereas the aim and will of the Merciful God inclined to the revelation and manifestation of Himself, and one opposite cannot be shown but by its opposite, and that Unique King of kings has no opposite or peer, therefore that Lord of the heart set up a Khalifa, to serve as a mirror to reflect His own sovereignty.","Therefore He gave him unlimited purity and light, and on the other side He set darkness opposing the light.","God set up two standards, a white and a black one, the one Adam and the other Iblis; And between these two mighty armies ensued war and battle and all we have witnessed.","Thus, too, in the second generation lived pure Abel; Cain was the opposite of his pure light.","In like manner these two standards of right and wrong were borne aloft till the age of Nimrod.","Nimrod was the opponent and adversary of Abraham, and their opposing camps warred and fought one another.","When God grew weary of the length of this war, his fire was appointed to arbitrate between them.","He commanded fire and its flaming forment to settle the matter in dispute between them.","Age after age these two parties contended, even till the time of Pharaoh and gentle Moses.","Between these two the war was waged for years, and when it passed all bounds and affliction increased god made the water of the Nile a judge between them, that the one who deserved preeminence should endure.","In like manner it went on till the time of Mustafa and Abu Jahl, that prince of iniquity.","Likewise did God ordain a punishment for the Thamud namely, an earthquake which destroyed their lives.","Likewise a punishment for the Adites, namely, a swiftly rising and violent wind.","Likewise God ordained acute punishment for Qarun; For the earth concealed wrath under its mildness, till all its mildness was converted into wrath, and it swallowed up Qarun and his wealth in its depth.","So with the mouthful which nourishes your body and wards off the darts of hunger like a cuirass, when God instils wrath into this mouthful of bread, that same bread will choke you like a halter.","This same garment which protects you from the cold, god may give it the quality of intense cold, so that this warm vest may become to your body cold as ice and biting as frost; So that you will cast off these furs and silks, and seek for a refuge from cold with cold itself.","You have only one eye, not two (for these two possibilities).","You have forgotten the story of the shadowing cloud.","Gods command came to city and village, and to house and wall, saying, Afford no shade!","Ward not off the pouring rain and the suns heat; Till those men hasted to listen to the prophet Shuaib saying, O king, have pity; most of us are dead!","But read the rest of the tale in the commentaries.","When that Omnipotent hand made the staff a serpent, if you have reason, that portent should suffice.","You have sight indeed, but fail to mark carefully; Your eyes are dimmed and closed with fat.","The heavenly treasure lies nearer to us than our neck-vein.","The Faqir was in this state when a divine voice came, and God thus solved his difficulties, saying, The voice told you to place an arrow on the bow, it did not bid you draw the bowstring to the utmost; It did not bid you draw the bow with all your might; It said, Adjust an arrow, not Draw the bow fully You elevated the bow to excess, you magnified unduly the bowmans art, go!","abandon this strong bowmanship, fix an arrow on the string, but make it not fly far.","When it falls, dig in that spot and search, abandon force and seek the treasure with humility.","God is what is nearer to you than your neck-vein, You have cast the arrow of speculation afar off.","O you, who have made ready your bow and arrows, the game is close to you, and you shoot too far off.","The further a man shoots, the further off he is, and the more removed from the treasure he seeks.","The philosopher kills himself with thinking, tell him that his back is turned to that treasure; Tell him that the more he runs to and fro, the Almighty says, Make efforts in our ways, Not Make efforts away from us, O restless one.","Like Canaan, who went away, from shame to follow Noah, up to the top of that lofty mountain, the more he sought safety on that mountain, the further was he removed from the safe asylum.","So this Faqir, in search of that hidden treasure, day after day drew his bow stronger and stronger; And the harder he drew his bow, the further was he from the seat of that treasure.","This parable applies to all times, for the soul of the ignorant is pledged to misfortune.","Because the ignorant man is ashamed of a master, perforce he goes and opens a new school for himself.","That school is higher than your true master, O beloved, and hard of access, and full of scorpions and snakes.","Straightway overthrow it, and turn back again to the green garden and sweet watered meadows.","Not like Canaan, who, through pride and ignorance, sought his ark of safety on a protecting mountain.","His far-shooting learning veiled his eyes, while his hearts desire was all the while in his grasp.","Ah!","oftentimes have learning and genius and wit proved to the traveler to be Ghouls and highwaymen!","The majority of those in Paradise are the simple, Who have escaped the snares of philosophy.","Strip yourself bare of overweening intellect, that grace may ever be shed upon you from above.","Cleverness is the opposite of humility and submission, quit cleverness, and consort with simple-mindedness!","Lofty philosophical speculation does not lead to the knowledge of God.","The Mosalman said, O my friends, my lord, the Prophet Muhammad, appeared to me and said, The Jew has hurried to the top of Sinai, and plays a game of love with Gods interlocutor; The Christian has been carried by Isa, Lord of bliss up to the summit of the fourth heaven thou who art left behind and hast endured anguish, arise quickly and eat the sweetmeats and confections!","Those two clever and learned men have ascended, and read their titles of dignity and exaltation; Those two exalted ones have found exalted science, and rivaled the very angels in intellect; O humble and simple and despised one, arise and eat of the banquet of the divine sweets!","They said to him, Then you have been gluttonous; Well indeed!","you have eaten all the sweets!","He answered, When my sovereign lord commanded me, who am I that I should abstain from obeying?","Would you, O Jew, resist the commands of Moses if he bade you do something, either pleasant or not?","Would you, O Christian, rebel against Isas commands, whether those commands were agreeable or the reverse?","How could I rebel against the Glory of the prophets?","Nay, I ate the sweets, and am now happy.","They replied, By Allah, you have seen a true vision; Your vision is better than a hundred like ours.","Your dream was seen by you when awake, O happy one, for it was seen to be real by your being awake.","Quit excessive speculation and inordinate science, Tis service of God and good conduct that gains its end.","Tis for this that God created us, We created not mankind save to worship us What profit did his science bring to Samiri?","His science excluded him from Gods portals.","Consider what Qarun gained by his alchemy; He was swallowed up in the depths of the earth.","Abu-I Jahl, again, what gained he from his wit save to be hurled head-foremost into hell for infidelity?","Know real science is seeing the fire directly, not mere talk, inferring the fire from the smoke.","Your scientific proofs are more offensive to the wise than the urine and breath whence a physician infers.","If these be your only proofs, O son, smell foul breath and inspect urine like physicians.","Such proofs are as the staff of a blind man, which prove only the blindness of the holder.","All your outcry and pompous claims and bustle only say, I cannot see, hold me excused!","He said, Alms of mercy repel calamity, alms cure thy sickness, O son Tis not charitable to burn up the poor, or to put out the eyes of the meek.","The prince replied, Kindness is good in its place, provided you do kindness in its proper place.","If at chess you put the king in the rooks place that is wrong; and so if you put the knight in the kings, the law prescribes both rewards and chastisements.","The kings place is the throne, the horses the gate.","What is justice but putting each in his place?","What injustice but putting each in what is not his place?","Nothing is vain of all that God has created, whether vengeance or mercy, or plain dealing or snares.","Not one of all these is good absolutely, nor is any one of them absolutely bad.","Each is harmful or beneficial according to its place, wherefore knowledge of these points is proper and useful.","Ah!","many are the chastisements sent to the poor which are more beneficial to him than bread and sweets; Because sweets out of season excite biliousness, while blows make him pure from impurity.","Strike the poor man timely blows, which may save him from being beheaded later.","The two friends discussed the matter long, and after discussion this plan was settled, that they should fetch a long string, by means of which to communicate with one another.","The mouse said, One end must be tied to your leg, and the other end to the leg of me, your double, that by this contrivance we two may be united, and be mingled together like soul and body.","Body is like a string tied to sods foot, that string drags soul down to earth.","The soul is the frog in the water of ecstatic bliss; Escaping from the mouse of the body, it is in bliss.","The mouse of the body drags it back with that string; Ah!","what sorrow it tastes through being dragged back if it were not dragged down by that insolent mouse, the frog would remain at peace in its water.","On the last day, when you shall awake from sleep, you will learn the rest of this from the Sun of truth!","He who, when he had once seen a person at night, recognized him without fail when he saw him by day, saw the king upon the throne, and straightway cried, This was he who accompanied us on our nightly walk; This is he whose beard possessed such rare talent; Our arrest is due to his sagacity.","He added, Yea, he was with you, this great king; He beheld our actions and heard our secrets.","My eyes guided me to recognize that king at night, and dwelt lovingly on his face, like the moon at night.","Now, therefore, I will implore his grace for myself, for he will never avert his face from him that knew him.","Know the eye of the  Knower is a safeguard in both worlds, for therein ye will find a very Bahram to aid you.","For this cause Muhammad was the intercessor for faults, because his eye did not wander from the King of kings.","In the night of this world, when the sun is hidden, he beheld God, and placed his hopes on Him.","His eyes were anointed with the words, We opened thy heart, He beheld what Gabriel himself had not power to see.","When he recovered himself he said, O God, i have sinned in looking for aid to a creature!","Although the Prefect showed great liberality, it was in no wise equal to Thy bounty.","He gave me a cap, but Thou my head full of sense; He gave me a garment, but Thou my tall form.","He gave me gold, but Thou my hand which counts it; He gave me a horse, but Thou my reason to guide it; He gave me a lamp, but Thou my lucid eyes; He gave me sweetmeats, but Thou my appetite for them; He gave me a pension, but Thou my life and being; His gift was gold, but Thine true blessings; He gave me a house, but Thou heaven and earth; In Thy house he and a hundred like him are nourished.","The gold was of Thy providing, he did not create it; The bread of Thy providing, and furnished to him by Thee.","Thou also didst give him his liberality, for thereby Thou didst augment his happiness.","I made him my Qibla, and directed my prayers to him; I turned away my eyes from Thee, the Qibla-maker!","Where was he when the Supreme Dispenser of faith sowed reason in the water and clay of man, and drew forth from Not-being this heavenly dome, and spread out the carpet of the earth?","Of the stars He made forches to illumine the sky, and of the four elements locks with keys (of reason).","Ah!","many are the buildings visible and invisible which God has made between heavens dome and earth.","Man is the astrolabe of those exalted attributes, the attribute of man is to manifest Gods signs.","Whatever is seen in man is the reflection of God, even as the reflection of the moon in water.","Say not two, know not two, call not on two!","Know the slave is obliterated in his lord!","So the lord is obliterated in God that created him yea, lost and dead and buried in his Creator!","When you regard this lord as separate from God, you annihilate at once text and paraphrase.","With eyes and heart look beyond mere water and clay, god alone is the Qibla; regard not two Qiblas!","If you regard two you lose the benefit of both; A spark falls on the tinder and the tinder vanishes!","Joseph kept in prison a long time for having placed his hopes of release in man and not in God.","In like manner Joseph, in the prison, with humble and earnest supplications begged aid, saying, When you are released, and are occupied with your ministrations to the king, remember me, and entreat the king to release rue too from this prison.","How can one prisoner fettered in the snare procure release for a fellow prisoner?","The people of the world are all prisoners, awaiting death on the stake of annihilation; Except one or two rare exceptions, whose bodies are in prison but their souls in heaven.","Be not intoxicated with these goblets of forms, lest you become a maker and worshipper of idols.","Pass by these cups full of forms, linger not; There is wine in the cups, but it proceeds not from them.","Look to the Giver of the wine with open mouth; When His wine comes, is not cup too small to hold it?","O Adam, seek the reality of my love, quit the mere husk and form of the wheat.","When sand was made meal for The Friend of God, Know, O master, the form of wheat was dispensed with.","Form proceeds from the world that is without form, even as smoke arises from fire.","The Divine art without form designs forms (ideals), those forms fashion bodies with senses and instruments.","Whatever the form, it fashions in its own likeness those bodies either to good or to evil.","If the form be blessing, the man is thankful; If it be suffering, he is patient; If it be cherishing, he is cheerful; If it be bruising, he is full of lamentation!","Since all these forms are slaves of Him without form, why do they deny their Lord and Master?","They exist only through Him that is without form; What, then, means their disavowal of their Sustainer?","This very denial of Him proceeds from Him, this act is naught but a reflection from Himself!","The forms of the walls and roofs of houses know to be shadows of the architects thought; Although stones and planks and bricks find no entrance into the sanctuary of thought, verily the Absolute Agent is without form, form is only a tool in His hands.","Sometimes that Formless One of His mercy shows His face to His forms from behind the veil of Notbeing, that every form may derive aid therefrom, from its perfect beauty and power.","Again, when that Formless One hides His face, those forms set forth their needs.","If one form sought perfection from another form, that would be the height of error.","Why then, O simpleton, do you set forth your needs to one who is as needy as yourself?","Since forms are slaves, apply them not to God, seek not to use a form as a similitude of God.","Seek Him with humbleness and self-abasement, for thought yields naught but forms of thought.","Still, if you are unable to dispense with forms, those occurring independently of your thought are best.","The Truth, which is our real self, lies hidden within our phenomenal and visible self, and the Prophets reveal it to us.","Now have we seen what the king saw at the first, when that Incomparable One adjured us.","The prophets have many claims to our gratitude, because they forewarn us of our ultimate lot, saying, What ye sow will yield only thorns; If ye fly that way, ye will fly astray.","Take seed of us to yield you a good harvest, fly with our wings to hit the mark with your arrow.","Now ye know not the truth and nature of the Truth, But at the last ye will cry, That was the Truth.","The Truth is yourself, but not your mere bodily self, your real self is higher than you and me.","This visible you which you fancy to be yourself is limited in place, the real you is not limited.","Why, O pearl, linger you trembling in your shell?","Esteem not yourself mere sugar-cane, but real sugar.","This outward you is foreign to your real  you; Cling to your real self, quit this dual self.","Your last self attains to your first (real) self only through your attending earnestly to that union.","Your real self lies hid beneath your outward self, for I am the servant of him who looks into himself  What a youth sees only when reflected in a glass, our wise old fathers saw long ago though hid in stones.","But we disobeyed the advice of our father, and rebelled against his affectionate counsels.","We made light of the kings exhortations, and slighted his matchless intimations.","Now we have all fallen into the ditch, wounded and crushed in this fatal struggle.","We relied on our own reason and discernment, and for that cause have fallen into this calamity.","We fancied ourselves free from defects of sight, even as those affected by color-blindness.","Now at last our hidden disease has been revealed, after we have been involved in these calamities.","The shadow of a guide is better than directions to God, to be satisfied is better than a hundred nice dishes.","A seeing eye is better than a hundred walking-sticks, eye discerns jewels from mere pebbles.","The princes ascertained the name of the lady depicted in the fort from an old Shaikh, who warned them of the perils they would encounter on their journey to China, and told them that the King of China would not bestow his favor on those who tried to gain it by tricks and clever stratagems, but solely on those who were prepared to yield up their lives to him, according to the saying, Die before you die.","This is illustrated by an anecdote of a Chief of Bokhara, who made it a rule never to bestow his bounty on beggars who asked for it, but only on those who awaited his pleasure in silence.","A certain Faqir tried many stratagems to evade this rule, but his craft was at once seen through by the Chief, and turned to his own confusion.","The thesis that the unbought free grace of God is superior to any blessing obtainable by human exertion and contrivance is further illustrated by an absurd anecdote of two youths, one of whom trusted for protection to his own contrivance, and found it a broken reed.","The Prophet said, Two there are who are never satisfied the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge; and he who loves knowledge will continue to trust in his knowledge, in spite of all exhortations and experience.","But the eldest prince advised his brothers to risk the perils and persevere in the journey, reminding them that Patience is the key of joy.","Accordingly they abandoned their country and their parents, like Ibrahim Adham, who renounced the throne of Balkh, and like the old Arabian king Amrul Qais, who fled from the pursuit of his female adorers to seek the Spiritual Beloved in a far country.","How the princes discoursed with one another in figurative language concerning their beloved mistress.","They told their secrets to one another in dark sayings, speaking beneath their breath in fear and trembling.","None but God was privy to their secrets, none but Heaven was partner in their sighs.","Yea, they used technical expressions one to another, and possessed intelligence to extract the sense.","The vulgar learn the words of this language of birds, And make boast of their mastery thereof; But these words are only the outward form of the language, the raw man is ignorant of the birds meaning.","He is the true Solomon who knows the birds language, a demon, though he usurp his kingdom, is quite another.","The demon has taken upon him the form of Solomon, his knowledge is fraud, not what we have been taught.","When Solomon was blessed with inspiration from God, he learned birds language from what we were taught.","But thou art only a bird of the air; understand then that thou hast never seen the true spiritual birds!","The nest of the Simurgh is beyond Mount Qaf, not every thought can attain thereto; Save thoughts which catch a glimpse thereof, and after the vision are again shut off.","Yet not all shut off, rather intermitted for a wise end, for the blessing abides, though shut off and hidden!","In order to preserve that body which is as a soul, the Sun is veiled for a while behind a cloud; In order not to melt that soul-like body, the Sun withdraws itself as from ice.","For thy souls sake seek counsel of these inspired ones.","Ah!","rob not their words of their technical meanings!","Zulaikha applied to Yusuf the names of all things, beginning with wild rue and ending with frankincense.","She veiled his name under all other names, and imparted her secret meaning to her confidants.","When she said, The wax is melted by the fire, She meant, My lover is wroth with me.","So when she said, See, the moon is risen!","Or, Lo!","the willow-bough is putting forth leaves; Or if she said, The leaves quiver in the wind, Or, The wild rue yields perfume as it burns; Or if she said, The rose tells her tale to the Bulbul, Or, The king sings his love-strain; Or if she said, Ah!","what a blessed lot!","Or, Who hath disturbed my hearts repose?","Or if she said, The water-carrier hath brought water, Or, Lo!","the sun emerges from the clouds; Or if she said, Last night the victuals were boiled, Or, The food was perfectly cooked; Or if she said, My bread is without savor Or, The heavens are revolving the wrong way; Or if she said, My head aches with pain, Or, My headache is now relieved; If she gave thanks, twas for being united to Yusuf; If she wailed, twas that she was separated from him.","Though she gave vent to thousands of names, her meaning and purport was only Yusuf; Was she an hungred, when she pronounced his name, she became filled and cheered by his nourishment.","Her thirst was quenched by Yusuf s name, his name was spiritual water to her soul.","Was she in pain, by pronouncing his mighty name at once her pain was turned into joy.","In the cold it was a warm garment; Her lovers name accomplished all this through love.","Strangers may pronounce the pure name of God, yet it effects no such marvels, for they lack love.","All that Isa accomplished by the name of Jehovah, zulaikha attained through the name Yusuf.","When the soul is intimately united with God, to name the one is the same as naming the other.","Zulaikha was empty of self and filled with love of Yusuf, and there flowed out of her jar what it contained.","The scent of the saffron of union made her smile, the stench of the onion of separation made her weep.","Each to have in his heart a hundred meanings, such is not the creed of true love and devotion.","The Friend is to the lover as day to the sun, the material sun is a veil over the face of the real day.","Whoso distinguishes not the veil from The Friends face is a worshipper of the sun; of such a one beware!","The Friend is the real day, and daily food of lovers, the heart and the hearts forment of His lovers.","Ah!","many earnest suppliants wail forth prayers, till the smoke of their wailing rises to heaven; Yea, the perfume of the incense of sinners groans mounts up above the lofty roof of heaven.","Then the angels supplicate God, saying, O Thou that hearest prayer and relievest pain, thy faithful slave is bowing down before Thee.","He knows of none on whom to rely save Thee; Thou bestowest favors on the helpless.","Every suppliant obtains his desire from Thee.","God makes answer, The delay in granting his prayer is intended to benefit him, not to harm him.","His pressing need draws him from his negligence to me; Yea, drags him by the hair into my courts.","If I at once remove his need he will go away, and will be destroyed in his idle sports.","Though he is wailing with heartfelt cry of O Aider!","Bid him wail on with broken heart and contrite breast.","His voice sounds sweet in my ears, and his wailing and cries of O God!","In this way by supplication and lamentation he prevails with me altogether.","It is on account of their sweet voices that choice parrots and nightingales are jailed in cages.","Ugly owls and crows are never jailed in cages; Such a thing was never heard of in history.","The disappointments of the pious, be sure, are appointed for this wise purpose.","In short, the King cherished him lovingly, and he like a moon waned in that sun.","That waning of lovers makes them wax stronger, just as the moon waxes brighter after waning.","Ordinary sick persons crave a remedy for sickness but the lovesick one cries, Increase my waning!","I have never tasted wine sweeter than this poison, no health can be sweeter than this sickness!","No devotion is better than this sin (of love), years are as a moment compared to this moment!","Long time he dwelt with the King in this manner, with burning heart, as a lively sacrifice.","Thus his life passed, yet he gained not the union He wished.","Patient waiting consumed him, his soul could not bear it; He dragged on life with pain and gnashing of teeth.","At last life ended before he had attained his desire.","The form of his earthly Beloved was hidden from him; He departed, and found union with his Spiritual Beloved.","Then he said, Though she lacks clothes of silk and wool, Tis sweeter to embrace her without those veils.","I have become naked of the body and its illusions, i am admitted into the most intimate union.","The story admits of being told up to this point, but what follows is hidden and inexpressible in words.","If you should speak and try a hundred ways to express it, Tis useless; the mystery becomes no clearer.","You can ride on saddle and horse up to the sea-coast, but then you must use a horse of wood (i.e., a boat).","A horse of wood is useless on dry land, it is the special conveyance of voyagers by sea.","Silence is this horse of wood, silence is the guide and support of men at sea.","This Silence which causes you annoyance is uttering cries of love audible to the spiritual.","You say, How strange the spiritual man is silent!","He answers, How strange you have no ears!","Though I utter cries, you hear them not; Sensual ears, however sharp, are deaf to my cries.","The spiritual man, as it were, cries in his sleep, uttering thousands of words of comfort; While the carnal man at his side hears nothing at all, for he is asleep, and deaf to the others voice.","But the perfect spiritualist who has broken his boat plunges into the sea as a fish of the sea (of Truth).","He is then neither silent nor speaking, but a mystery.","No words are available to express his condition.","That marvelous one is in neither of these states Twould be irreverent to explain his state more fully.","These illustrations are weak and inappropriate, but no fitter ones are obtainable from sensible objects.","In short, the vengeance of That Jealous One (God) After one year bore him to the grave.","When the King awoke out of his trance to consciousness, his Mars-like eyes shed tears of blood.","When that incomparable one looked into his quiver, he saw that one of his arrow-shafts was missing.","He cried to God, What has become of my arrow?","God answered, Thy arrow is fixed in his throat!","That King, bountiful as the sea, had pardoned him; Nevertheless his arrow had dealt him a mortal wound.","He was slain, and cried out with his last breath, The King is all in all, my slayer and my savior.","If he is not both these, he is not all in all; Nay, he is both my slayer and my mourner!","That expiring martyr also gave thanks, that the King had smitten his body, not his spirit; For the visible body must perforce perish, ere the spirit can live in happiness for evermore.","Though he incurred chastisement, it affected his body only, and as a friend he now goes, free of pain, to his Friend.","Thus at first he clung to the Kings stirrup, but at last went his way guided by perfect sight.","Finally, the youngest brother, who was the weakest of all, succeeded where his brothers had failed, and obtained his earthly mistress, the kings daughter, as his bride, and the spiritual Beloved as well.","Here the Masnavi breaks off; but, according to the Bulaq edition, the following conclusion was supplied by Jalalu-d- Dins son, Bahau-d-Din Sultan Valad: Part of the story remains untold; it was retained in his mind and was not disclosed.","The story of the princes remains unfinished, the pearl of the third brother remains unstrung.","Here speech, like a camel, breaks down on its road; I will say no more, but guard my tongue from speech.","The rest is told without aid of tongue to the heart of him whose spirit is alive.","Rumi stated: Mohammed, the great Prophet, once said, The worst of scholars are those who visit princes, and the best of princes are those who visit scholars.","Wise is the prince who stands at the door of the poor, and wretched are the poor who stand at the door of the prince.","Now, taking the outward sense of these words, people think that scholars should never visit princes or they will become the worst of scholars.","That is not the true meaning.","Rather, the worst of scholars are those who depend upon princes, and who revolve their life and purpose around the attention and favor of princes.","Such scholars take up learning in hopes that princes will give them presents, hold them in esteem, and promote them to office.","Therefore, such scholars improve themselves and pursue knowledge on account of princes.","They become scholars from their fear of princes.","They subject themselves to the princes control.","They conform themselves to the plans that princes map out for them.","So, whether they visit a prince, or a prince visits them, still in every case theyre the visitors, and it is the prince who is visited.","However, when scholars do not study to please princes, but instead pursue learning from first to last for the sake of truth — when their actions and words spring from the truth they have learned and put to use because this is their nature and they cannot live otherwise — just as fish can only thrive in water — such scholars subject themselves to the control and direction of God.","They become blessed with the guidance of the prophets.","Everyone living in their time is touched by them and derives inspiration from their example, whether they are aware of the fact or not.","Should such scholars visit a prince, they are still the ones visited and the prince is the visitor, because in every case it is the prince who takes from these scholars and receives help from them.","Such scholars are independent of the prince.","They are like the light-giving sun, whose whole function is giving to all, universally, converting stones into rubies and camelians, changing mountains into mines of copper, gold, silver and iron, making the earth fresh and green, bringing fruit to the trees, and warmth to the breeze.","Their trade is giving, they do not receive.","The Arabs have expressed this in a proverb: We have learned in order to give, we have not learned in order to take.","And so in all ways they are the visited, and the prince is the visitor.","The thought comes to me at this point to comment on a verse of the Koran, although it is not related to the present discourse.","However, this idea comes to me now, and I want to express it so that it can go on record.","O Prophet, say to the prisoners in your hands.","If God knows of any good in your hearts, He will give you more than He has taken, and He will forgive you.","Surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate."," This verse was revealed when Mohammed had defeated the unbelievers, slaying, plundering and taking prisoners, whom he tied hand and foot.","Amongst the prisoners was his uncle, Abbas.","The chained people wept and wailed all night in their helpless humiliation.","They had given up all hope of their lives, expecting the sword and slaughter.","Mohammed, seeing this, laughed.","Look!","the prisoners exclaimed.","He shows the traits of a person after all.","This claim that he is superhuman is not true.","There he stands looking at us prisoners in these chains, enjoying it.","Just like everyone ruled by their passions — when they gain victory over their enemies and see their opponents vanquished to their will, they rejoice and feel happiness.","Not so, answered Mohammed, seeing what was in their hearts.","Never would I laugh at the sight of enemies conquered by my hand, or the sight of your suffering.","But I do rejoice, in fact I laugh, because with inner vision I see myself dragging and drawing people by collars and chains, out of the black smoke of Hell into Paradise, while they complain and cry, Why are you pulling us from this pit of self-destruction into that garden of security?","So, laughter overcomes me.","But since you have not yet been granted the vision to see what I am saying, listen.","God commands me to say this to you: First you gathered your forces and mustered your might, trusting completely in your own virtue and valor.","You said to yourselves, We will conquer the Muslims and vanquish them.","But you did not see that One Power more powerful than yourselves.","You did not know the One Force above your force.","And so all that you planned turned out the opposite.","Even now in your fear, you still hold onto your beliefs and do not see the One Reality over you.","Rather than facing that Power, you see my power, because it is easier for you to see yourselves conquered by me.","But even in your present state, still I say to you: If you recognize my power, and accept yourselves vanquished to my will in all circumstances, I can still deliver you from this grief.","He, who is able to bring forth a black bull from a white bull, can also produce a white bull from a black bull.","Turn away from your former ways, and likewise I will return to you all the property that has been taken from you, in fact many times as much.","Even more, I will absolve you of all blame, and grant you prosperity in this world and the world to come.","I have repented, said Abbas.","I have turned from my former ways.","Mohammed said, God demands a token of this claim you make, for easy it is to boast of love, but other is the proof thereof.","In Gods name, what token do you demand?","asked Abbas.","Give all the properties that remain to you for the army of Islam, so the army of Islam may be strengthened, said Mohammed.","That is, of course, if you have truly become a Muslim and desire the good of Islam and Muslimdom.","Prophet of God, what remains to me?","said Abbas.","They have taken everything, leaving me not so much as an old reed-mat.","You see, said Mohammed, you have not yet given up your old ways.","You have not yet seen the light of truth.","Should I tell you how much property you still have?","Where you have hidden it?","To whom you have entrusted it?","Where you concealed and buried it?","God forbid!","exclaimed Abbas.","Did you not entrust so much property specifically to your mother?","asked Mohammed.","Did you not bury your gold under such and such a wall?","Did you not tell your mother in detail, If I return, give this back to me.","But if I do not return safely, then spend so much upon such and such an object, and give so much to So-and-So, and so much is to be for yourself?","When Abbas heard these words he raised his hand in complete acceptance.","Prophet of God, he said, truly, I have always thought you carried the fortune of the old kings, such as Haman, Shaddad, Nimrod and the rest.","But now that you have spoken I know this favor is divine, from the world beyond, from the throne of God.","Now you have spoken truly, said Mohammed.","This time I have heard the snapping of the girdle of doubt, that you had within you.","I have an ear hidden within my inmost Soul, and with that hidden ear I can hear the snapping of doubt within anyone.","Now it is true for a fact that you believe.","I have told this story to the Amir for this reason: In the beginning you came forward as a champion of Muslimdom.","I ransom myself, you said.","I sacrifice my own desires, considerations and judgement so that Islam will remain secure and strong.","But because you put your trust in your own plans, loosing sight of God, and forgetting that all things proceed from God, all your intentions have turned out the opposite.","Having struck a bargain with the Tartars, you are unintentionally giving them assistance to destroy the Syrians and the Egyptians, which in the end may bring ruin to the realm of Islam.","So God has turned this plan you made for the survival of Islam, into its own destruction.","Turn your face to God, for things are in a dangerous condition.","Yet, even in your present state, my friend, do not give up hope, but look to God and give yourself up to Its will.","You thought your own strength of spirit proceeded from yourself, just as Abbas and the prisoners did, thus you have fallen into weakness.","But do not give up hope, because He, who can produce weakness from strength, can bring forth an even greater strength from this weakness.","Just as Mohammed rejoiced during the prisoners grief, so too I find joy in your present embarrassment, because from this weakness and suffering can come something greater than has been lost.","Therefore, do not give up hope, for Of Gods comfort no one despairs, Except the unbelievers.","My purpose in speaking this way to the Amir was so that he could see the matter correctly, and accept the will of God humbly.","He has fallen out of an exceedingly high state into a low state, yet in this way he may grow.","Life can show the most wonderful things, but behind all of them lies a trap should we forget the source of this wonder.","God has devised this plan so that we will learn not to claim, out of arrogance and vanity, these ideas and plans as our own.","If everything were in truth as it appears to be, Mohammed, endowed as he was with a vision so penetrating, so illuminated, would never have cried, Lord, show me things as they are.","You show a thing as fair, and in reality it is ugly.","You show a thing as ugly, and in truth it is beautiful.","Show us everything just as it is, So that we will not Jail into the snare.","Now, your judgement, however good and luminous it may be, is certainly not better than the Prophets judgement.","So do not put your trust in every idea and every notion, but only in God and Its wisdom.","Someone said: Our Master does not utter a word.","Rumi answered: Well, it was the thought of me that brought you to my presence.","This thought of me did not speak with you saying, How are things with you?","The thought without words drew you here.","If the reality of me draws you without words and transports you to another place, what is so wonderful with words?","Words are the shadow of reality, a mere branch of reality.","Since the shadow draws, how much more the reality!","Words are a pretext.","It is the inner bond that draws one person to another, not words.","If someone should see a hundred thousand miracles and divine blessings, still, without an inner connection to that saint or prophet who was the source of those miracles, all these phenomena would come to nothing.","It is this inward element that draws and moves us.","If there were no element of amber in straw, the straw would never be attracted to the amber [Rumi is referring to static electricity here].","They would not cling to each other, even if you rubbed the amber with fur.","This exchange between them is hidden, not a visible thing.","It is the thought that brings us.","The thought of a garden brings us to the garden.","The thought of a shop brings us to the shop.","However, within these thoughts is a secret deception.","Have you never gone to a certain place thinking it would be good, only to find disappointment?","These thoughts then are like a shroud, and within that shroud someone is hidden.","The day reality draws you and the shroud of thought disappears, there will be no disappointment.","Then you will see reality as it is, and nothing more.","So, what reason is there for me to speak?","In reality that which draws is a single thing, but it appears to be many.","We are possessed by a hundred different desires.","I want vermicelli, we say.","I want ravioli.","I want halvah.","I want fritters.","I want fruit.","I want dates.","We name these one by one, but the root of the matter is a single thing: he root is hunger.","Dont you see how, once we have our fill of but one thing, we say, Nothing else is necessary?","Therefore, it was not ten or a hundred things, but one thing that drew us.","The many things of this world are a trial appointed by God, for they hide the single reality.","There is a saying that the saint is one, humankind is a hundred, meaning the saints whole attention remains upon the one truth, while people are scattered over a hundred appearances.","But which hundred?","Which fifty?","Which sixty?","Lost in this world of mirrored reflections, they are a faceless people without hands and feet, without mind and Soul, quivering like a magic talisman, like quicksilver or mercury.","They do not know who they are.","Call them sixty or a hundred or a thousand, and the saint is one, but is not this view a trial itself?","For the truth is that the hundreds are nothing, while the saint is a thousand, and a hundred thousand, and thousands of thousands.","A king once gave a single soldier the rations for a hundred men.","The army protested, but the king said nothing.","When the day of battle arrived, all the men fled the field, except that one soldier who fought alone.","There you are, the king said.","It was for this I fed one man as a hundred.","It behooves us to strip away all our prejudices and seek out a friend of God.","However, when weve spent our whole life in the company of people who lack discrimination, then our own discriminative faculty becomes weak, and that true friend may pass us by unrecognized.","Discrimination is a quality that is always hidden in a person.","Dont you see that an insane person possesses hands and feet but lacks discrimination?","Discrimination is a subtle essence within you.","Yet, day and night you have been occupied with nurturing the physical form that does not know right from wrong.","Why have you devoted all your energies to looking after the physical, entirely neglecting that subtle essence?","The physical exists through that essence, but that essence in no way depends on the physical.","The light that shines through the windows of the eyes and ears — if those windows did not exist, the light would not stop.","It would find other windows to shine through.","If you bring a lamp before the sun, do you say, I see the sun by means of this lamp?","God forbid!","If you did not bring the lamp, the sun would still shine.","What need is there for a lamp?","This is the danger in associating with kings.","It is not that you may lose your life — we must lose our life in the end anyway, whether today or tomorrow does not matter.","The danger arises from the fact that when kings enter upon the scene, and the spell of their influence gains strength, becoming like a great lamp, the person who keeps company with them, claims their friendship, and accepts money from them will inevitably speak in accordance with their desires.","That person will listen to the kings mundane views with the utmost attention, and will not be able to deny them.","That is where the danger lies, it leads to a fading respect for the true source.","When you cultivate the interest of kings, that other interest which is fundamental to the spiritual life becomes a stranger to you.","The more you proceed down the path of kings, the more that direction where the Beloved dwells becomes lost.","The more you make your peace with worldly people, the more the Beloved turns away from you.","Going in their direction renders you subject to their rule.","Once you have turned down their path, in the end God gives them power over you.","It is a pity to reach the ocean, and to be satisfied with a little pitcherful from the sea.","After all, there are pearls in the sea, and from the sea come a myriad of precious things.","What is the value in just taking water?","What pride can intelligent people have in that?","This world is a mere foam fleck of the True Sea.","That Ocean is the science of the saints, and within that Water is the Pearl Itself.","This world is but foam full of floating jetsam.","Yet, through the turning of the waves, and the rhythmic surging of the sea in constant motion, this foam takes on a certain beauty.","But this beauty is a borrowed thing coming from elsewhere.","It is a false coin that sparkles to the eye.","People are the astrolabe of God, but it requires an astronomer to use the astrolabe.","If a vegetable-seller or a greengrocer should find the astrolabe, what good would it do them?","From that astrolabe, what could they know of the movements of the circling stars and the positions of the planets, their influences and so forth?","But in the hands of the astronomer, the astrolabe becomes truly valuable.","Just as this copper astrolabe reflects the movements of the heavens like a mirror, so the human being is the astrolabe of God.","Those who have been moved by God to see the one reality and leam Its ways through the astrolabe of their own being, behold moment by moment, flash by flash, the testament of God.","Indeed, it is an infinite beauty that never leaves their mirror.","God has servants who cloak themselves in a wisdom, knowingness and grace invisible to others.","Out of their excessive jealousy and love for God these servants cloak themselves, just like Mutanabbi says of beautiful women: Figured silks they wore, not to beautify But to guard their beauty from lustful eyes.","The Amir said: Night and day my heart and Soul are intent upon serving God, but because of my responsibilities with Mongol affairs I have no time for such service.","Rumi answered: Those works too are work done for God, since they are the means of providing peace and security for your country.","You sacrifice yourself, your possessions, your time, so the hearts of a few will be lifted to peacefully obeying Gods will.","So this too is a good work.","God has inclined you towards such good work, and your great love for what you do is proof of Gods blessing.","However, if your love of work were to weaken, this would be a sign of grace denied, for God leads only those who are worthy into those right attitudes that will earn spiritual rewards.","Take the case of a hot bath.","Its heat comes from the fuel that is burned, such as dry hay, firewood, dung and the like.","In the same way, God uses what to outward appearance looks evil and nasty, yet in reality is the means to cleanliness and purity.","Like the bath, the man or woman fired by the efforts of work becomes purified and a benefit to all people.","(At this point some friends arrived.","Rumi excused himself and said:) If I do not attend to you, and do not welcome you or ask after you, this is really a mark of respect.","Respect is what is appropriate for the occasion.","When someone is at prayer, they should not stop to greet their father and brother.","Disregard of friends while being engaged in prayer is the highest regard, and the greatest courtesy, since that person does not break away from absorption with God on account of dear ones.","This saves those loved ones from being subject to Divine reproach.","Therefore, true respect is not a social pleasantry, but is concern for the spiritual honor of others.","Rumi answered: Yes, but it is also prayer.","It is prayer without the outward form.","This outer form of prayer is the body of prayer, since it has a beginning and ending.","Everything that has a beginning and ending is a body.","All words and sounds have a beginning and an end, and therefore are form and body.","But the inner soul of prayer is unconditioned and infinite, and has neither beginning nor end.","Now, Mohammed, who invented the Muslim prayer, said, I have a time with God not contained by any prophet, nor limited by any angel next to God.","Hence we realize that the soul of prayer is not the outer form alone.","Rather it is a complete absorption, a state without room for these outward forms.","Gabriel himself, who is pure reality, cannot be found therein.","It is related that one day friends found my father in a state of complete absorption.","The hour of prayer arrived, and these friends called out to my father, It is time for prayer.","My father did not heed their words, so they arose and occupied themselves with the prayer.","However, two friends stayed with my father and did not stand up to pray.","Now, one of those who were praying was named Khvajagi.","It was shown to him clearly, in his inward heart, that all those who were at prayer were standing behind the Prophet with their backs turned to Mecca, while the two who were with my father were facing Mecca.","Since my father had passed away from any sense of personal identity, his self no longer remaining, having been consumed in the Light of God, he had become the Light of God.","Whoever turns their back on the Light of God, and faces the wall of their prayer-niche, has surely turned their back on Mecca.","For Gods light is the soul of the Mecca-ward direction.","Mohammed once rebuked a friend, saying, I called you.","Why didnt you come?","The friend replied, I was occupied with prayer.","The Prophet said, Well, wasnt I calling you for God?","The friend answered, I am helpless.","It is good to feel helpless every moment, seeing yourself helpless in success, just as in failure.","For above your capacity there is a greater Capacity, and your will is subject to that greater Will in every case.","You are not divided into two halves, now capable, now helpless.","You are always helpless, only sometimes remembering, sometimes forgetting.","When you remember, then the heart of that moment becomes visible, and the way opens up before you.","Indeed, what is our condition, seeing that lions, tigers and crocodiles are all helpless and tremble before God?","Even the heavens and earth are helpless and subject to His decree.","God is a mighty emperor.","Its Light is not like the light of the moon or sun where some form abides in its place.","When Gods Light shines forth unveiled, neither heaven nor earth remain.","Neither sun nor moon.","Nothing remains but that great Reality.","A certain king said to a dervish, In the moment when you find revelation and propinquity in the Court of God, remember me.","The dervish replied, When I come into that Presence, and the Light of that Sun shines upon me, I will no more remember myself.","How then can I remember you?","Even still, make a request of such a dervish, who is utterly absorbed, and even without them mentioning you or your needs in Gods presence still the request is fulfilled.","There was once a king who had a favorite and highly confidential servant.","Whenever that servant set out for the royal palace, people who had a request to make presented him with their histories and their letters, begging him to submit them to the king.","He would place the documents in his wallet.","On coming into the kings presence, he could not endure the splendor of the kings beauty, and would fall down dumfounded.","The king would then, in a loving manner, put his hand into his wallet, saying, What does this servant of mine have here, who is utterly absorbed in my beauty?","In this way he found the letters and would endorse the petitions of every man and woman, and then return the documents into the wallet.","So he would attend to the needs of every one of them, without that servant ever submitting them, so that not a single one was rejected.","On the contrary, their demands were granted many times over, and they attained far more than they had asked for.","But in the case of other servants who retained consciousness, and were able to present and indicate to the king the histories of the people in need — out of a hundred requests and a hundred needs, only one might be fulfilled.","Someone said: There is something I have forgotten.","Rumi replied: There is one thing in this world that must never be forgotten.","If you were to forget all else, but did not forget that, then you would have no reason to worry.","But if you performed and remembered everything else, yet forgot that one thing, then you would have done nothing whatsoever.","It is just as if a king sent you to the country to carry out a specific task.","If you go and accomplish a hundred other tasks, but do not perform that particular task, then it is as though you performed nothing at all.","So, everyone comes into this world for a particular task, and that is their purpose.","If they do not perform it, then they will have done nothing.","All things are assigned a task.","The heavens send rain and light for the herbs of the field to germinate and spring into life.","The earth receives the seeds and bears fruit, it accepts and reveals a hundred thousand marvels too numerous to tell.","The mountains give forth mines of gold and silver.","All these things the heavens, the earth and the mountains do, yet they do not perform that one thing; that particular task is performed by us.","We offered the Trust to the heavens, The earth and the mountains, They refused to cany it and were afraid of it, But humans carried it.","Surely they are foolish and sinful.","So, people are given a task, and when they perform it all their sinfulness and foolishness is dissolved.","You say, Look at all the work I do accomplish, even if I do not perform that task.","You werent created for those other tasks!","It is just as if you were given a sword of priceless Indian steel, such as can only be found in the treasuries of kings, and you were to treat it as a butchers knife for cutting up putrid meat, saying, I am not letting this sword stand idle, I am using it in so many useful ways.","Or it is like taking a solid gold bowl to cook turnips in, when a single grain of that gold could buy a hundred pots.","Or it is as if you took a Damascene dagger of the finest temper to hang a broken gourd from, saying, I am making good use of it.","I am hanging a gourd on it.","I am not letting this dagger go to waste.","How foolish that would be!","The gourd can hang perfectly well from a wooden or iron nail whose value is a mere farthing, so why use a dagger valued at a hundred pounds?","A poet once said: You are more precious than heaven and earth.","What more can I say?","You do not know your own worth.","God says, I will buy you...","your moments, your breaths, your possessions, your lives.","Spend them on Me.","Turn them over to Me, and their price is divine freedom, grace and wisdom.","This is your worth in My eyes.","But if we keep our life for ourself, then we lose what treasures we have been granted.","Like the person who hammered the dagger, worth a hundred pounds into the wall to hang a gourd upon, their great fortune was reduced to a nail.","Still you offer another excuse, saying, But I apply myself to lofty tasks.","I study law, philosophy, logic, astronomy, medicine and the rest.","Well, for whose sake but your own do you study these?","If it is law, it is so nobody can steal a loaf from you, strip you of your clothes, or kill you — in short, it is for your own security.","If it is astronomy, the phases of the spheres and their influence upon the earth, whether they are light or heavy, portending tranquility or danger, all these things are concerned with your own situation, serving your own ends.","If it is medicine, it is related to your own health and also serves you.","When you consider this matter well, the root of all your studies is yourself.","All these lofty tasks are but branches of you.","If these subjects are filled with so many marvels and worlds of knowledge without end, consider what worlds you pass through who are the root!","If your branches have their laws, their medicines, their histories, think of what transpires within you who are the source; what spiritual laws and medicines affect your inward future and fate, what histories portray your struggles of the heart!","For Soul there is other food besides this food of sleeping and eating, but you have forgotten that other food.","Night and day you nourish only your body.","Now, this body is like a horse, and this lower world is its stable.","The food the horse eats is not the food of the rider.","You are the rider and have your own sleeping and eating, your own enjoyment.","But since the animal has the upper hand, you lag behind in the horses stable.","You cannot be found among the ranks of kings and princes in the eternal world.","Your heart is there, but since your body has the upper hand, you are subject to its rule and remain its prisoner.","When Majnun, as the story goes, was making for his beloved Lailas home, as long as he was fully conscious he drove his camel in that direction.","But when for a moment he became absorbed in the thought of Laila and forgot his camel, the camel turned in its tracks toward the village where its foal was kept.","On coming to his senses, Majnun found that he had gone back a distance of two days journey.","For three months he continued this way, coming no closer to his goal.","Finally he jumped off the camel, saying, This camel is the ruin of me!","and continued on foot, singing: My camels desire is now behind, My own desire is before.","Our purposes were crossed, We can agree no more.","Burhan al-Din was once greeted by someone, who said, I have heard praises of you sung by friends.","Burhan al-Din answered, Wait until I meet your friends to see whether they know me well enough to praise me.","If they know me only by word of mouth, then they do not truly know me.","For words do not endure.","Syllables and sounds do not endure.","This body, these lips and this mouth will not endure.","All these things are mere accidents of the moment.","But if they know me by my works, and they know my essential self, then I know they are able to praise me, and that praise will go where it belongs.","This is like the story they tell of a certain king.","This king entrusted his son to a team of learned scholars.","In due course, they taught him the sciences of astrology, geomancy, and the interpretation of signs, until he became a complete master, despite his utter stupidity and dullness of wit.","One day the king took a ring in his fist and put his son to the test.","Come, tell me what I am holding in my fist.","What you are holding is round, yellow, inscribed and hollow, the prince answered.","You have given all the signs correctly, the king said.","Now say what it is.","It must be a sieve.","the prince replied.","What?","cried the king.","You know all the minute details, which would baffle the minds of anyone.","How is it that out of all your powerful learning and knowledge, the small point has escaped you that a sieve will not fit in a fist?","In this same way, the great scholars of the age split hairs on details of all matters.","They know perfectly and completely those sciences that do not concern Soul.","But as for what is truly of importance and touches us more closely than anything else, namely our own Self, this your great scholars do not know.","They make statements about everything, saying, This is true and that is not true.","This is right and that is wrong.","Yet, they do not know their own Self, whether it is true or false, pure or impure.","Now being hollow and yellow, inscribed and circular, these features are accidental; cast the ring into the fire and none of them will remain.","It becomes its essential self, purified of all appearances.","So it is with the knowledge of scholars; what they know has no connection with the essential reality that alone exists when all these signs are gone.","They speak wisely, expound at great length, and finally pronounce that what the king has in his hand is a sieve.","They have no knowledge about the root of the matter: lifes purpose.","I am a bird.","I am a nightingale.","If they say to me, Make some other kind of sound,I cannot.","My tongue is what it is.","I cannot speak otherwise.","However, those who learn the song of birds are not birds themselves — on the contrary, they are the enemies of birds and their captors.","They sing and whistle so others will take them for birds.","Ask them to produce a different sound and they can do so, because that sound is merely assumed by them.","It is not truly their own.","Like the scholars, they are able to sing other songs because they have learned to rob those songs, and to show off a different tune stolen from every breast.","The Amir, surprised by an unexpected visit from Rumi, said: Master, how gracious of you to honor me in this way.","I never expected this.","It never even entered my mind that I could be worthy of such an honor.","By rights I should be standing night and day in the ranks and company of your servants and attendants.","Im not even worthy of that.","How gracious this is!","Rumi said: It is all because of your lofty spiritual aspirations.","The higher and greater your rank and the more you become occupied with important, exalted worldly affairs, the more you consider yourself to have fallen short of your spiritual purpose.","You are not satisfied with what you have achieved, thinking that you have too many obligations.","Since none of these attainments can blind you from that divine attainment, my heart is moved to serving you.","And yet for all that, still, I wanted to pay you formal honor as well.","Form too possesses great importance.","No, much more than importance — it is of true substance.","Just as the body will fail if it lacks a heart, so too it fails without a skin.","If you plant a seed with no husk, it cannot grow, but if you bury it in the earth with its shell, then it germinates and becomes a great tree.","So, form is a great and necessary principle, and without it our task fails and our purpose is not attained.","Yes, this principle is reality in the eyes of those who know reality and have become reality!","A dervish once entered the presence of a king.","The king addressed him, Oh, ascetic.","You are the ascetic, the dervish answered.","How can I be an ascetic, the king demanded, since the whole world belongs to me?","Ah, you see things the opposite of what they are, replied the dervish.","This world and the next and all that there is to possess, these all belong to me.","I have seized the whole world.","It is you who have become satisfied with a mouthful and a rag.","Wherever you turn, there is the Face of God.","This Face runs and extends infinitely and forever.","True spiritual lovers have sacrificed themselves for the sake of that Face, desiring nothing in return.","The rest of the human race are like cattle.","Yet, even though they are cattle, still they deserve favor.","They may live in the stable, yet they are accepted by the Lord of the stable.","If He so desires, He transfers them from this stable into His private pen.","So, in the beginning God brought men and women into existence, and then transferred them from the pen of spiritual existence into the world inanimate.","Then from the pen of the world inanimate into the vegetable world.","Then from vegetable into animal.","From animal to human, human to angel, and so on forever.","He manifested all these forms so that you would know His pens are many, and that each one is loftier than the next.","God revealed this present world so that you could accept the other stages that lie ahead.","He did not reveal it so that you would say, This is all there is.","The masters of crafts demonstrate their abilities and arts so their apprentices will find faith in them, and will believe in the other arts they have not yet demonstrated.","A king bestows robes of honor and lavishes kindness on his subjects because they look forward to receiving other gifts from him, and hang hopefully upon future purses of gold.","He does not grant these things for them to say, This is all there is.","The king will not give out any other blessings, and so make do with that amount.","If the king knows any subjects are going to say that, and take such gifts for granted, he will never bestow any blessings whatsoever upon them.","The ascetic is one who sees the hereafter, while the worldling sees only the stable.","But the chosen ones of God, who have true knowledge, see neither the hereafter nor the stable.","Their eyes are fixed on the first principle, the source of all things.","When the chosen one sows wheat they know that wheat will grow, because they see the end from the beginning.","So it is with barley and rice and all things — seeing the beginning, their eyes are not fixed on the end.","They know the conclusion from the start.","Such men and women are rare.","It is pain that guides us in every enterprise.","Until there is an ache within, a passion and a yearning for that thing arising within us, we will never strive to attain it.","Without pain it remains beyond our reach, whether it is success in this world or salvation in the next, whether we aim at becoming a merchant or a king, a scientist or an astronomer.","It was not until the pains of birth manifested in Mary that she made for the tree.","Those pangs drove her to the tree, and the tree that was withered became fruitful.","We are like that story of Mary in the Koran.","Every one of us has a Jesus within, but until the pangs manifest, our Jesus is not born.","If the pangs never come, then our child rejoins its origin by the same secret path through which it came, leaving us empty, without the birth of our true self.","Your inward soul is hungry.","Your outward flesh is over fed.","The devil has gorged to sickness.","The king begs even for bread.","The cure is found while Jesus is here on earth!","But once he returns to heaven, all hope will have fled.","Rumi said: These words are for the sake of those who need words to understand.","But as for those who understand without words, what use have they for speech?","The heavens and earth are words to them, sent forth themselves from the Word of God.","Whoever hears a whisper, what need have they for shouting and screaming?","An Arabic speaking poet once came into the presence of a king.","Now the king was a Turk, and did not even know Persian.","The poet had composed in his honor some brilliant verses in Arabic, and had brought these with him.","When the king had taken his seat on the throne and the courtiers were all present and duly stationed, commanders and ministers each in their place, the poet rose to his feet and began to recite his poem.","At every passage deserving applause the king nodded his head, while at every passage provoking astonishment he looked amazed.","Similarly, he responded to every passage expressing submission.","The courtiers were astounded.","Our king did not know a word of Arabic, they murmured amongst themselves.","How is it that he nodded his head so correctly?","He must have known Arabic all these years and kept it hidden from us.","If we have ever uttered incivilities in Arabic, then woe is us!","Now the king had a favorite slave.","So the courtiers assembled together and gave the slave a horse, a mule, and a sum of money, and they promised to give him this much again.","Just find out whether or not the king knows Arabic, they said to him.","If he does not, how was it that he nodded just at the right places?","Was it a miracle?","Was it divine inspiration?","Finally one day the slave found his opportunity.","The king was out hunting, and the slave perceived that he was in a good mood, since the hunt had gone well.","So he asked the king point blank.","The king burst out laughing.","By God, I dont know Arabic, he said.","As for nodding and applauding, I knew of course what the poets object was in composing that poem, and so I nodded and applauded.","So it was realized that the root of the matter was the purpose desired; the poem itself was merely the branch of that purpose.","If it had not been for that purpose, the poet would never have composed that poem.","If our real purpose is kept in view, duality vanishes.","Duality shows the branches, but the root is one.","It is the same with Sufi sheikhs.","Although to outward appearance they have various styles of teaching and differ widely in their social standing, even in their action and words, yet from the standpoint of their purpose they all have one goal, namely the quest for God.","Take the case of the wind.","When it blows through a house it lifts the edges of the carpet, and the rugs flap and move about.","It whisks sticks and straws into the air, ruffles the surface of the pool until it looks like a coat of mail, sets trees and twigs and leaves a-dancing.","All those conditions appear distinct and different, yet from the standpoint of the object, the root and reality, they are one thing — the movement of the wind.","Rumi replied: When this thought enters a per-sons mind and they criticize themself, saying, What am I about, and why do I do these things?","When this happens, it is a sure proof that God loves them and cares for them.","Love continues so long as reprimands continue, said the poet.","We may reprimand our friends, but we never reprimand a stranger.","Now there are levels of reprimand.","When a person is stung by it and sees the truth in it, that is a sign that God loves them and cares for them.","But if the reprimand flies by that person without causing any pain at all, then this is no sign of love.","When a carpet is beaten to get rid of the dust, intelligent people do not call that a reprimand.","But if a woman beats her own darling child, then that is called a reprimand and is a proof of her love.","Therefore, as long as you find pain and regret within yourself, that is a proof of Gods love and guidance.","If you find fault in your brother or sister, the fault you see in them is within yourself.","The true Sufi is like a mirror where you see your own image, for The believer is a mirror of their fellow believers.","Get rid of those faults in yourself because what bothers you in them bothers you in yourself.","An elephant was led to a well to drink.","Seeing itself in the water, it shied away.","It thought it was shying away from another elephant.","It did not realize it was shying away from its own self.","All evil qualities — oppression, hatred, envy, greed, mercilessness, pride — when they are within yourself, they bring no pain.","When you see them in another, then you shy away and feel the pain.","We feel no disgust at our own scab and abscess.","We will dip our infected hand into our food and lick our fingers without turning in the least bit squeamish.","But if we see a tiny abscess or half a scratch on anothers hand, we shy away from that persons food and have no stomach for it whatsoever.","Evil qualities are just like scabs and abscesses; when they are within us they cause no pain, but when we see them even to a small degree in another, then we feel pain and disgust.","Just as you shy away from your brother or sister, so you should excuse them for shying away from you.","The pain you feel comes from those faults, and they see the same faults.","The seeker of truth is a mirror for their neighbors.","But those who cannot feel the sting of truth are not mirrors to anyone but themselves.","A certain king was sitting, dejected, on the bank of a river.","The generals were nervous and afraid of him.","His face would not clear up no matter what they tried.","Now he had a jester whom he treated as a great favorite.","The generals promised the jester a certain sum of money if he could make the king laugh.","So the jester approached the king, but despite all his efforts the king would not so much as look at him.","The king kept staring into the river and did not lift his head at all.","What do you see in the water?","the jester asked the king.","I see the husband of an unfaithful wife, the king replied.","King of the world, the jester said, your slave is also not blind.","So it is in your own case.","If you see something in your fellow that pains you, after all they also are not blind.","They see exactly what you see.","In Gods presence two Is cannot exist.","You cannot know your self and Gods Self; either die before God, or God will die before you so that duality will not remain.","But as for Gods dying, that is both impossible and inconceivable, for God is the Living, the Immortal.","So gracious is He that if it were at all possible He would die for your sake.","Since that is not possible, then you must die so that God can reveal Itself to you, and duality can vanish.","Tie two birds together, and despite their familiarity and the fact that their two wings have been changed to four, they will not fly.","That is because duality exists.","But let one bird give up its life and the other — even though tied to the first — will fly, because duality has vanished.","Shams-i-Tabriz was a servant of God who had the power to sacrifice himself for the sake of a friend.","He prayed to God for that friend, but God did not accept his petition.","I do not want you to help him, came a voice.","Shams, that son of the Sun [Shams-i-Tabriz means literally Sun of Tabriz,] persisted and would not cease his requests, saying, O God, you have implanted this desire for him, and it will not leave me.","Finally a voice came saying, Do you desire that this should come to pass?","Then sacrifice your self, and become nothing.","Do not wait, and leave this world behind.","Lord,Shams answered, I am content.","So he did; he gambled away his life for the sake of that Friend, and his desire was accomplished.","[The friend in this story is Rumi himself.","Shams was chased away by jealous followers of Rumi, but Rumi sent for Shams and Shams eventually returned.","It is said that those jealous followers, including one of Rumis own sons, later murdered Shams.","Rumis search for the missing Shams, only to find the One he sought for within himself, is the source of many of Rumis poems.] If a servant of God can possess such grace as to sacrifice his life, of which one days portion is worth the life of all the world from first to last, does not the Source of that grace also possess this love?","It would be absurd to think otherwise.","But since it is not possible for God to pass away, at least you can.","A fool came and sat in a seat above one of the great saints.","What difference does it make to the saints whether such a person is above or below the lamp?","If the lamp wants to be on high, it does not desire that for its own sake.","Its purpose is for the benefit of others, so they can enjoy their share of the light.","Wherever the lamp may be, whether below or above, it is still the lamp of the Eternal Sun.","If the saint seeks worldly rank and office, it is for this purpose: They desire to snare those worldlings, who do not have the vision to see their true elevation, with a trap of worldly rank.","Through this they may find their way to the higher worlds, and fall into the trap of divine grace.","In this same way, the Prophet, Mohammed did not conquer Mecca and the surrounding lands because he was in need of them.","He conquered in order to give life and grant light to all people.","This is a hand accustomed to give, it is not accustomed to take.","The saints beguile people in order to bestow gifts on them, not to take anything away.","When someone lays a trap and catches little birds to eat and sell, that is called cunning.","But if a king lays a trap to capture an untutored and worthless hawk, having no knowledge of its own true nature, to train it to his own forearm so that it may become ennobled, that is not called cunning.","Though to outward appearance it is cunning, yet it is known to be the very acme of caring and generosity, restoring the dead to life, converting the base stone into a ruby, and far more than that.","If the hawk knew for what reason the king wanted to capture it, it would not require any bait.","It would search for the trap with soul and heart, and would fly to the kings hand.","People only listen to the outward significance of the saints words.","They say, Weve heard plenty of this.","Our hearts are stuffed full of words of this kind.","God says, God forbid that you should be full of them!","You are full of your own whisperings and vain conceits.","You are full of illusion and greed.","Nay, you are full of cursing.","If only they were empty of such ravings!","Then they would be open to receive these words.","But they are not open to receive them.","God has set a seal upon their ears and eyes and hearts.","Their eyes see things the opposite of what they are; they hear wisdom as gibberish and raving.","Their hearts have been transformed into a home of self-love and vanity.","A winters tangle of dark shapes and pride has possessed them.","Their hearts are hardened with ice and frost.","God has set a seal on their hearts and their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering.","How likely is it that such people could be full of these true words?","They have never caught so much as a whiff of them.","They have never tasted a drop in all their lives — neither they nor those they worship, nor their miserable household.","God shows a pitcher to everyone.","To some It shows the pitcher full of water, and they drink until they are sated.","But to some God shows it empty.","What thanks can someone give for an empty pitcher?","Only those, whom God shows the pitcher full, find thanks for this gift.","The son of the Amir entered.Rumi said: Your father is always occupied with God.","His faith is overwhelming, and reveals itself in his words.","One day your father said, The people of Rum have urged me to give my daughter in marriage to the Tartars, so that our religion may become one, and this new religion of Muslimdom can disappear.","I said, When has religion ever been one?","There have always been two or three, and they have always had war and fighting between them.","How do you expect to make religion one?","It will be one only in the next world, at the resurrection.","As for this present world, it isnt possible here, for here each religion has a different desire and design.","Here unity is impossible.","It will be possible only at the resurrection, when humanity becomes one and all people fix their eyes on one place, and all have one ear and one tongue.","Within us are many things.","There is mouse in us, and there is bird.","The bird carries the cage upwards, while the mouse drags it down.","A hundred thousand different wild beasts are together within us, but they are all converging on that moment when the mouse will renounce its mouse-hood and the bird its birdhood, and all become one.","For the goal is neither going up or down.","When the goal shows itself clearly, it will be neither above nor below.","A woman lost something.","She looks left and right, in front and behind.","Once she has found that thing she no longer searches above and below, left and right, in front or behind.","All at once she becomes calm and collected.","Similarly, on the resurrection day all people will be of one eye, tongue, ear and understanding.","When ten friends share a garden or a shop in common, they speak as one, they plan as one, and their work is with one thing since their objective is the same.","So, on the resurrection day, since the affair of all will be with God, they will all be one.","In this world everyone is preoccupied with a separate affair.","One is in love with women, one is in love with wealth, another is engaged in acquiring possessions, another in acquiring knowledge.","Everyone believes that their cure, their joy, their pleasure and comfort can be found in that one thing.","And that is a Divine mercy, because when they search they cannot find, and so they return.","After they have waited a while, they say again, That joy and pleasure must be looked for.","Perhaps I didnt try hard enough.","I will search again.","Then they look again, but still they cannot find their desire.","So they continue, until that time when Truth removes Its veil.","Then they know.","But God has certain servants who know even before the resurrection.","Ali [cousin and son-in-law of Mohammed] said, Even if the veil was removed, my faith would not increase.","That is to say, Even when the body is gone and the resurrection appears, my certainty can become no greater.","This is like a group of people at prayer on a dark night; they turn their faces in every direction, being unable to see.","When day comes they all turn themselves around, except for that one individual who through the night was facing towards Mecca.","Why should that individual turn around?","So, those special servants of God keep their faces towards the One even in the night, and have turned their faces away from all else.","Therefore, for them, the resurrection is already manifest and present.","There is no end to words, but they are given according to the capacity of the seeker.","Wisdom is like the rain.","Its supply is unlimited, but it comes down according to what the occasion requires — in winter and spring, in summer and autumn, always in due measure, more or less, but the source of that rain is the oceans itself, which has no limits.","Druggists put sugar or drugs in a twist of paper, but sugar is not limited by the amount in the paper.","The stocks of sugar and the stocks of drugs are unlimited and unbounded; how can a piece of paper contain them?","Some people uttered taunts at Mohammed, saying, Why does the Koran come down upon you word by word?","Why not chapter by chapter?","Mohammed answered, What do these fools say?","If it were to come down upon me all at once, I would dissolve and vanish away.","Those who truly understand a little, understand much; of one thing, many things; of one line, whole volumes.","It is like when a group is seated listening to a story, but one woman knows all the circumstances, having been there when it occurred.","From the first hint she understands it all.","She turns pale, then crimson, changing from one feeling to another.","The others understand only as much as they hear, since they do not know what really happened.","But the one who knows understands the whole story from even a few words.","To return: When you come to the druggist, they have sugar in abundance.","But they see how much money you brought, and give accordingly.","By money is meant sincerity and faith.","The words are imparted according to ones sincerity and faith.","When you come seeking sugar, they examine your bag to see what its capacity is, then they measure out accordingly, one bushel or two.","But if someone brings a string of camels, they call the weighmen to be help.","So, someone comes along whom oceans do not satisfy; another finds a few drops enough and any more would be harmful.","This applies not only to the world of ideas, sciences and wisdom.","It is true of everything.","Property, wealth, gold, all are unbounded and infinite, but they are imparted according to the capacity of the individual.","Who could support an endless supply without being driven mad?","Do you not see how Majnun and Farhad, and the other famous lovers, took to the mountain and desert for the love of a woman, when they were filled with a passion beyond their power to control?","Do you not see how Pharaoh, when empire and wealth were showered upon him without end, laid claim to being a god?","Yes, indeed these people have faith, but they do not know what that faith is in.","In the same way a child has faith it will have bread to eat, but they dont know where this bread comes from.","It is the same with all things that grow.","A tree turns yellow and dry of thirst, but it doesnt know what thirst really is.","Our faith is like a flag.","First we set the flag fluttering in the air to proclaim our belief, and then send troops to the foot of that flag from every direction to support and defend it.","We send reason, understanding, fury and anger, forbearance and liberality, fear and hope, on and on without end.","Whoever looks from afar sees only the flag, but those who see from close at hand know the essences and realities that reside within us.","Someone came in and Rumi said: Where have you been?","We have been longing to see you.","Why have you stayed away?","The visitor replied, It was just how things conspired.","Rumi said: We, for our part, have been praying that this conspiracy of things might come to an end.","A conspiracy of things that produces separation is an improper conspiracy.","Yes, by God, it too comes from God, and in relation to God is good.","It is a true saying, that all things are good and perfect in relation to God, but in relation to us, how can this be true?","Fornication and purity, avoiding prayer and praying, unbelief and Islam, idolatry and Gods unity — with God all these are good.","But to us, fornication and thieving, unbelief and idolatry are bad, while Gods unity and prayer are good.","Even though in relation to God all are good.","A king has in his realm prisons and gallows, robes of honor and wealth, estates and attendants in waiting, feasting and celebration, drums and flags.","In relation to the king all these things are good.","Just as robes of honor are the perfect flourish for his kingdom, in the same way gallows and prisons are perfect ornaments.","In relation to him all these things are perfect, but in relation to his people how could robes of honor and the gallows be one and the same?","Someone asked: What is greater than prayer?","Rumi said: One answer is that the soul of prayer is greater than prayer, as I have already explained.","A second answer is that faith is greater.","Prayer is a series of daily actions, while faith is continuous.","Prayer can be dropped for a valid reason, or can be postponed, but it is impossible to drop or postpone faith for any excuse.","And where prayer without faith gains nothing, as in the case of hypocrites, faith without prayer is valuable.","Another point: while the prayer of every religion is each quite different, still, faith does not change from religion to religion.","The states that it produces, its place in life, and its effects are the same everywhere.","There are other advantages to faith, but their discovery depends upon the inward awareness of the listener.","Each listener is like flour in the hands of a dough-maker.","Words are like water sprinkled on the flour according to the moisture needed.","But unless the water soaks in, it cannot make dough.","A poet said: My eye is fixed upon another, what shall I do?","Look to yourself, for that eye s light is you.","My eye is fixed upon another.","That means you are seeking something apart from yourself, like the dryness of the flour that longs for water from the dough-makers hand.","What can I do?","Know that you seek only yourself, that longing is for you.","The light you seek is your own light reflected, but you will not escape this blinding glare of the outward lights until your own Inner Light becomes a hundred thousand times greater.","There was once a skinny person, feeble as a sparrow, and exceedingly ugly.","He was so ugly that even other ugly people looked on him with contempt and gave thanks to God, though before seeing him they used to complain of their own ugliness.","Yet, for all that, he was very rude in his way of speaking and bragged enormously.","He was in the court of the king, and his behavior pained the vizier, but the vizier swallowed it down.","Then one day the vizier lost his temper.","People of the court, he shouted.","I picked this creature out of the gutter and nourished him.","By eating my bread and sitting at my table, by enjoying my charity and my wealth, and that of my ancestors, he became somebody.","Now he has reached the point of saying such things to me!","People of the court, cried the man, springing up in the viziers face, and nobles and pillars of the state!","What he says is quite true.","I was nourished by his wealth and charity and that of his ancestors until I grew up, contemptible and crude as you see me.","If I had been nourished by someone elses bread and wealth, surely my appearance, my manners and my worth would have been better than this.","He picked me out of the gutter; but all I can say is; Oh, I wish that I were dust.","If someone else had picked me out of the gutter, I would not have been such a laughing stock.","The disciple, who is fed at the table of a lover of God, has a clean and true spirit.","But those who are nourished by the hands of an imposter and a braggart, learning the science from them, become just like their teacher, contemptible and feeble, weak and unable to make up their minds about anything.","Within our being all sciences were originally joined as one, so that our spirit displayed all hidden things, like clear water shows everything within it — pebbles, broken shards and the like — and reflects the sky above from its surface like a mirror.","This is Souls true nature, without treatment or training.","But once Soul has mingled with the earth and its earthly elements, this clarity leaves it and is forgotten.","So God sends forth the prophets and saints, like a great translucent ocean that accepts all waters, and yet no matter how dark or dirty are the rivers that pour into it, that ocean remains pure.","Then Soul remembers.","When it sees its reflection in that unsullied water, it knows for sure that in the beginning it too was pure, and these shadows and colors are mere accidents.","The prophets and the saints, therefore, remind us of our original state; they do not implant anything new.","Now, every water, no matter how dark, that recognizes that great water, saying, I come from this and I belong to this, is truly a part of that ocean.","But the dark elements that do not recognize that ocean and believe they are kin to another kind, they make their home with the colors and shadows of the earth.","It was for this reason that the Prophet said, Now there comes to you a Messenger from amongst yourselves.","In other words, the great ocean is that same substance as your own water, it is all from one self and one source.","But for those elements that do not feel the attraction of familiarity, this failure does not come from the water itself, but from the pollution in that water.","This pollution is mixed in so closely that the water does not know whether its own shying away from the ocean comes from itself, or from the essence of that pollution.","And so, evil men do not know whether their attraction toward evil springs from their own nature, or from some dark element mingled in.","Every line of poetry the saints and prophets bring forth, every tradition, every verse they write, is like a witness bearing testimony.","They bear witness to every situation according to the nature of the situation.","In the same way we have two witnesses at the inheritance of a house, two witnesses at the sale of a shop, two witnesses at a marriage.","So too, the saints bear witness.","The inner form of their testimony is always the same; it is the outer meaning that differs.","I pray that God may cause these words to bear witness to God and you alike.","Someone said: A man came who wanted to see you.","He kept saying, I wish I could have seen the Master.","Rumi said: He does not see the Master at this moment because in truth the desire that filled him, namely to see the Master, was a veil hiding the Master.","So it is with all desires and affections, all loves and fondnesses that people have for every variety of thing — father, mother, heaven, earth, gardens, palaces, knowledge, things to eat and drink.","The lover of God realizes all these desires are truly the desire for God, and they are all veils covering humanitys eyes.","When we pass into the next world and behold Reality without these veils, then we realize all those were veils and coverings, and that our true quest in reality is for one thing.","All difficulties are then resolved, we hear in our hearts the answer to all questions, and everything is seen clearly face to face.","It is not Gods way to answer every problem separately, but with one answer all questions are satisfied.","All at once the total struggle is resolved.","In the same way, in winter everyone puts on warm clothes and a leather jacket, and then creeps for shelter from the cold.","So too all plants, trees, and shrubs, bitten by the cold, remain without leaves and fruit, storing and hiding their goods and nourishment inwardly so that the grasp of winter will not reach them.","When spring, in a single epiphany, answers their requests, then all their various problems, whether human, animal or plant, are resolved, and those secondary symptoms disappear.","Then all put forth their heads, and realize the cause of their misery.","God has created these veils for a good purpose.","For if Gods beauty were displayed without a veil, we would not have the power to endure it.","Through the intermediary of these veils we derive life and enjoyment.","Look at the sun.","Through its light we can distinguish good from bad, and find warmth.","Trees and orchards become fruitful from its heat, and their fruits — unripe, sour and bitter, become mature and sweet.","Through its influence, mines of gold and silver, rubies and camelians are produced.","But if the sun were to come nearer it would bring no benefit whatsoever.","On the contrary, the whole world and every creature would be burned up and destroyed.","When God reveals Itself through a veil to the mountain, those slopes become fully arrayed in trees and flowers and verdure.","However, when God brings revelation without a veil, It destroys the mountain and breaks it into atoms.","Someone asked: Well, isnt this the same sun in the winter?","Rumi answered: Our purpose here was to draw a comparison.","It is not a matter of atoms, or Adam.","Similarity is one thing, comparison is another.","Although our mind cannot comprehend that reality, yet how can mind abandon the effort?","If our reason gave up the struggle, it would no longer be reason.","Reason is that thing that perpetually, night and day, is restless while thinking and struggling, striving to comprehend, even though God is unknowable and incomprehensible.","Reason is like a moth, and the Beloved is like a candle.","Whenever the moth dashes itself against the candle, it is consumed and destroyed, but the moth is this way by nature.","No matter how much that consuming flame and agony may hurt, the moth cannot fly from the candle.","If there were another creature like the moth that could not fly away from the light of the candle, and dashed itself against that light, that would not be a mere comparison, that would be a moth itself.","But if the moth dashed itself against the light of the candle and the moth were not consumed, that indeed could not be a candle.","Therefore, the human being who can do without God, lacking even the desire, that is no human being at all.","But if they are able to comprehend God, that indeed could not be God.","So, the true lover is never free from striving, they revolve restlessly and ceaselessly around the light of God.","And God consumes them, making them nothing, destroying the veil of their reason.","The Amir said to Rumi: Before you arrived just now, your eldest son, Baha al-Din, excused himself to me, saying, My father said that he doesnt want to put you to any trouble when you come to visit him.","He says, I am subject to various states of consciousness.","In one state I speak, and in another I do not.","In one state I attend to the affairs of others, and in another state I withdraw and go into retreat, while in yet another state I am utterly absorbed and beyond this world.","I do not wish the Amir to come when Im in a state of being that is disagreeable, when I am unable to counsel and converse with him.","Therefore, it is better that when I am free and able to attend to my friends and do them some good, that I should go out and visit them.","The Amir went on: I answered Baha al-Din, saying, I do not come here so that our Master should attend to me and converse with me.","My purpose in coming is to have the honor of being amongst the company of his servants.","For example, just now you were preoccupied and did not show yourself until you had kept me waiting for a long time.","This was so I would realize how difficult and disagreeable it is if I keep others waiting when they come to my door and I do not readily admit them.","You have made me taste the bitterness of that and have given me a lesson so that I will not act like that with others.","Rumi answered: Thats not true.","On the contrary, my keeping you waiting is an expression of utmost loving-kindness.","Just as God declares, O my child, I would answer your smallest petition and slightest complaint without delay, if it werent that the voice of your complaint is so sweet to my ears.","My answer lingers unspoken in hopes that you might complain again and again, for the sound of your voice is so sweet to me.","For example, two beggars come to the door of a certain person.","One is highly loved and sought after, while the other is disliked.","The owner of the house says to a slave, Give that hated one a piece of bread quickly and without delay, so he will leave right away.","To the other beloved beggar the owner makes promises, saying, The bread is not yet baked.","Wait patiently until the bread is properly cooked and baked.","My greater desire is to see my friends, to gaze my fill upon them and they on me.","For when friends see deeply into one another here, below, and they are raised into the other world after become very familiar here, they quickly recognize one another there.","Knowing how closely they were together in the world of mortality, their reuniting brings great joy.","For all too quickly we lose our friends.","Do you not see how in this mortal world you become the friend and darling of some person, and they become the very Joseph of beauty in your eyes.","Then, on account of a single shameful act they vanish from your sight, and you lose them completely?","That Joseph-like form is changed into a wolf.","This very same one you once saw as Joseph you now see as a wolf.","Yet, their actual form has not changed, but is still the same as it always was.","By that one accidental act you lost them.","Tomorrow, when this present essence is changed into another essence, since you never really knew that person deeply, and never penetrated thoroughly into their essence, how are you going to recognize them?","The lesson to be learned from this is that we must see one another very well indeed.","We must pass beyond the good and bad qualities that are present temporarily in everyone, and must enter into the others very essence.","We must see with exceptional clarity that these qualities people observe in one another are not their original qualities.","The story is told of a man, who said, I know that fellow very well.","I will give his distinguishing mark.","His friends said, Please do.","The man answered, He was a muleteer of mine.","He had two black cows.","People talk in this same way.","I consider So-and-so my friend.","I know them.","Yet every distinguishing mark they give is just like the two black cows.","Those are not distinguishing marks.","Those marks are of no use whatever.","So, we must pass beyond the good and evil in others and enter into their essence to see what they really are.","That is truly seeing and knowing.","It astonishes me how some people say, How do saints and lovers of God find love in the eternal world beyond form, space and time?","How can they gain strength and help?","How are they affected by things without body or shape?","Is not all life, night and day, engaged with these very things?","One person loves another person and derives help through that love.","They find care and grace, kindness and knowledge, happiness and sorrow.","All these belong to that formless world.","Moment by moment they receive benefits from these abstractions and are affected by them.","However, this doesnt surprise the doubters.","Yet they are amazed that saints can find love in the invisible worlds, and derive help without form.","Once there was a philosopher who denied this reality.","One day he became so sick he could not leave his bed, and his illness dragged on a long time.","A certain theologian went to visit him.","What are you seeking?","the theologian asked.","Health, said the philosopher.","Tell me how this health is shaped, so that I may find it for you.","It has no shape, said the philosopher.","It is indescribable.","If it is indescribable, then how can you look for it?","the theologian demanded.","All I know, answered the philosopher, is that when health arrives I grow in strength.","I become plump, fresh and alive.","From illness we learn of health, said the theologian.","From what is describable we learn of what is indescribable.","Now abandon your doubting ways and I will return you to your vital self.","Though spiritual truth is inscrutable, still we all benefit from it through the embodiment of form.","Just as you see the changes brought by the stars, moon and sun turning in the sky, the rain from clouds in due season, summer and winter, and all the transformations of time.","You see all these things happen, and know that it is right and in accordance with wisdom.","But how does that distant cloud know it is necessary to rain at its appointed time?","Or how does this earth, when it receives a seed, know to return it tenfold?","Well, Someone does this.","Behold that Someone through the embodiment of this world, and find nourishment.","Just as you use the body of another person to contact their essence, use the embodiment of this world to touch That reality.","When the Prophet was transported out of himself and spoke, he used to say, God says.","Now, from the standpoint of embodiment, it was his tongue that spoke; but he wasnt there at all.","That speaker was greater than he was.","Mohammed, knowing himself to be ignorant and without knowledge of such words, when he heard the wisdom coming through his own lips, he realized that he was no longer what he had been.","Something greater moved him.","He reported stories about past people and prophets who lived thousands of years before, and he told what would come to pass even to the end of the world.","His being was but a thing of years.","A mortal being surely cant describe such things.","How can a creature born in time give information about the eternal?","And so it became known that it was not he who was speaking.","God was speaking.","God is wholly free of form and words.","Its speech is beyond letters and voice.","Yet, It delivers Its message by any letters and voice and tongue It desires.","People have carved the figures of men, women and birds of stone along the banks of pools on the highways and in the caravansaries, and through the mouths of those statues water pours into the pool.","Anyone with any sense knows that this water does not begin in the mouth of a stone bird, it comes from some other source.","If you want to get to know people, engage them in speech.","By their words you will know them.","If they are imposters, even if someone told them that people can be recognized by their words and they watch their words carefully to avoid being caught, still, in the end you will come to understand who they are.","This is illustrated by the story of the child and her mother.","A child in the desert said to her mother, On dark nights a horrible demon appears to me, and I am terribly afraid.","Dont be afraid, said her mother.","The next time you see that form, attack it bravely.","Then you see clearly that it is nothing but a fantasy.","But mother, said the child, what if the horrible demons mother has given him similar advice?","What shall I do if she has taught him, saying, Dont give in, so she will think you are real and powerful.","And dont say a word, so that you wont be exposed?","How shall I recognize him then?","Keep silent, yield to his form as it is, and wait with patience, her mother answered.","Sooner or later some word will leap from his mouth.","Or if it does not, from your own heart some words will spring forth unconsciously, or into your mind some thoughts or ideas will spring up, so that out of those thoughts you will know him for what he is.","For this is how he has affected you.","This is a reflection of his true self and his real feelings that have sprung up inside of you.","Sheikh Sar-razi was seated one day amongst his disciples.","One of the disciples had a longing for some roasted sheeps head.","The Sheikh called to his servant, saying, Bring him some roasted sheeps head.","How did you know that he wanted roasted sheeps head?","the disciples asked.","Because it is now thirty years since such desires have filled me, the Sheikh answered.","I have cleansed and purified myself of all desires and have become clear as a polished mirror.","When the thought of roasted sheeps head entered my mind, whetted my appetite and became a desire, I knew it belonged to our friend.","For a mirror shows no image of itself.","Any image it reflects is the image of another.","A worthy man once shut himself in a cave for forty days discipline, seeking spiritual enlightenment.","A voice came to him, saying, Such a lofty goal will never be attained by forty days discipline.","Abandon your cave so the love of a great saint may reach you and your goal can be realized.","Where shall I find that great one?","the man asked.","In the congregational mosque, came the answer.","In such a throng of people, how shall I recognize which one he is?","he inquired.","Go, said the voice, he will recognize you and will gaze upon you.","The sign that his love has fallen upon you will be when the pitcher drops from your hand and you become unconscious.","Then you will know that his gaze has reached you.","The man acted accordingly.","He filled a pitcher with water and went around the congregation in the mosque like a water-carrier.","He was wandering between the ranks of the worshippers when suddenly he was seized with ecstasy.","He uttered a loud cry, and the pitcher fell from his hand.","He remained in a comer of the mosque unconscious.","All the people left.","When he came to his senses he saw that he was alone.","He could not see the spiritual king who had gazed upon him, but he had gained his goal.","There are certain lovers of God, who, because of their great majesty and jealousy for God, do not show themselves openly, but they cause disciples to attain important goals and bestow gifts upon them.","Such mighty spiritual saints are rare and precious.","Someone said: Do the great ones come before you?","Rumi answered: There is no before left to me.","It has been a long time since I have had any before.","If they come, they come before an image they believe to be me.","Some people said to Jesus, We will come to your house.","Jesus replied, Where is my house in this world, and how could I have a house?","It is related that Jesus was wandering in the desert when a great rainstomi broke.","He went to take shelter in the den of a jackal, in the comer of its cave, until the rain ceased.","A revelation came to him, saying, Get out of the jackals den, for the jackals little ones cannot rest on account of you.","He cried aloud, Lord, the jackals pups have a shelter, but the son of Mary has no place to call home.","Although the jackals whelp has a cave to live in, still it has no Beloved to drive it out of its home.","But you do have such a One driving you out.","If you have no home, what does that matter?","The loving-kindness of such a Driver, and the grace from such a robe of honor that singles you out to be driven forth, is worth far more, exceeding a hundred thousand heavens and worlds here and beyond.","After the Amir left, Rumi said: The fact that the Amir came and I didnt show my face at once should not worry him.","His purpose in coming was either to pay honor to me or to himself.","If it was to pay honor to me, then the longer he sat and waited, the greater the honor he gained.","If, on the other hand, his object was to honor himself and to seek a reward, then since he waited and endured the pain of waiting his reward will be all the greater.","In either case his object in coming was realized many times over, so he should feel thankful and fortunate.","Rumi said: The saying, Hearts bear witness to one another, refers to a hidden reality.","If all reality were openly revealed, what need would there be for words?","Similarly, when the heart bears witness, what need is there for the testimony of the tongue?","The Amir said: Certainly the heart bears witness.","But the heart plays one part by itself, the ear another, the eye another, the tongue another.","There is need for each one, so that the whole can be realized.","Rumi said: If the heart is totally absorbed, then all the other senses are obliterated in it, and there is no need for the tongue.","Take the case of Laila: She was not a spiritual being, but of flesh, fashioned of water and clay.","Yet passion for her produced such absorption, and so utterly seized and overwhelmed Majnun, that he had no need to see Laila with his eyes, no need to hear her voice.","He could not separate himself from the thought of her, causing him to cry: Your name is upon my tongue.","Your image is in my sight.","Your memory in my heart, Where can I send these words I write?","The physical has such power that passion can bring us into a state where we are never apart from our beloved.","All our senses are absorbed: sight, hearing, smell and the rest.","No sense seeks a separate view, all being united.","If each sense plays its part in full, all are immersed in one experience and desire nothing else.","Seeking for a separate view proves that one sense has not found its true, whole allotment.","It is enjoying an incomplete portion and therefore is not immersed, nor fulfilled.","Then the other senses begin seeking their own part, and all become divided.","From the viewpoint of reality, all the senses see one thing, but from the standpoint of outward form they are each different from the other.","When one sense is moved to absorption, all the senses become absorbed in it.","When a fly flies upward it moves its wings, its head and its whole body separately; but when it is immersed in honey, then all its parts are alike — none can move at all.","Absorption is such that whoever enters it is no longer there.","They make no more efforts, they cease to act and move.","They are immersed in the water.","No action is their action; it is the action of the water.","But if they flail about in the water with their hands and feet, they are not truly submerged.","If they utter a cry, I am drowning, this too is not absorption.","Take the famous utterance, I am God.","Some people think this is a great pretension, but I am God is in fact a great humility.","Those who say, instead, I am a servant of God believe that two exist, themselves and God.","But those who say, I am God have become nothing and have cast themselves to the winds.","They say, I am God meaning, I am not, God is all.","There is no existence but God.","I have lost all separation.","I am nothing.","In this the humility is greater.","This is what ordinary people dont understand.","When they render service in honor of Gods glory, their servanthood is still present.","Even though it is for the sake of God, they still see themselves and their own actions as well as God — they are not drowned in the water.","That person is drowned when no movement, nor any action belongs to them, all their movements spring from the movement of the water.","A lion was chasing a deer, and the deer was fleeing.","There were two beings evident: the lion and the deer.","But when the lion caught up with the deer, and the deer was overpowered beneath the lions clutch, and out of terror became unconscious and senseless, collapsing before the lion in that moment only the lion remained.","The deer was effaced and no longer existed.","True absorption is when God creates in saints a fear.","This is not the fear of men and women who are scared of lions, leopards and death.","Rather, it is the fear of separation.","This fear is a gift from God, just as security, pleasure and joy, eating and sleeping — all these are gifts from God.","God shows the saints, while they are fully conscious, forms that only they can see.","The inner form of the lion, leopard, and fire become visible so they will know that reality is not of this world, but of the world unseen, projected forth to them.","In the same way, they are shown their own Self in magnificent form.","Likewise, gardens and rivers, maids of Paradise and palaces, all types of food and drink, robes of honor, fleet steeds, cities, castles and every kind of marvel — they know these are not of this world.","God shows and reveals these secrets before their eyes.","Thus they come to know with certainty that fear of separation comes from God, as do security, comfort and all spiritual displays.","Now this fear of separation does not resemble the fears that most men and women know, because it is a result of revelation and experience.","God clearly shows the saint that all things belong to God.","The philosophers may know this, but they know it by intellectual proof, and proof is not permanent.","The pleasure that comes from proof will not last.","When the memory of the proof passes, its warmth and thrill pass away as well.","Thus, we know by proof that this house had a builder.","We know by proof that this builder had eyes and was not blind, had power and was not powerless, was living and not dead, and existed before the house was built.","All these facts we know, but we know them by proof.","Such proof is not permanent, and is soon forgotten.","Lovers of God, however, being absorbed in God, have come to know the Builder and have seen with the eye of knowingness.","They have eaten bread and salt together, and mingled the two.","The Builder is never absent from their heart and their gaze.","Men and women such as this pass away in God.","With them, sin is not sin, and crime is not crime, since they are absorbed.","A certain king ordered his slaves, every one, to take in their hand a golden cup to greet a guest.","His favorite slave was also commanded to take a cup.","When the king showed his face, that special slave, on beholding the king, lost control of himself and was overwhelmed.","The cup fell from his hand and was shattered.","When the other slaves saw this they said, Perhaps we should do this as well, and they cast down their cups deliberately.","Why did you do that?","the king scolded them.","He was your favorite, and that was what he did, they replied.","Fools!","the king cried out.","He didnt do that.","I did it.","To outward eyes, all of the slaves were sinful.","But that one act was the very acme of obedience.","Indeed, it transcended obedience and sin.","Of them all, the true lover was that one slave.","The others were but followers of the king.","Thus, they followed that slave, since he had become the essence of the king, only outwardly wearing the form of slavery.","He was filled with the beauty of the king.","God declares, If it werent for you, I would never have created the heavens.","This is the same as I am God.","It means, I created the heavens for I love you as Myself.","This is I am God in another language and another tongue.","Though the words of the great saints appear in a hundred different forms, since God is one and the Way is one, how can their words be different?","Though their teachings appear to contradict, their meaning is one.","Separation exists in their outward form only; in inner purpose they all agree.","A prince orders a tent to be stitched.","One person twists the rope, another strikes the pegs, another weaves the cloth, another stitches, another rends, another uses a needle.","Though to outward appearance they are diverse and different, in inner purpose they are united and performing a single task.","So it is with the affairs of this world.","When you look at it carefully, all are doing Gods service; reprobate and righteous, sinner and disciple, devil and angel.","For example, the king wants to test and try his slaves so the steadfast can be sorted from the weak-hearted, the loyal from the traitor, the faithful from the fake.","If he did not have tempters and provokers, how could he test his slaves loyalty?","So, the tempters and provokers are serving the king, since it is by the kings will that they act.","He sends a wind to show the difference between the stable and the unstable, to separate the gnat from the sparrow-hawk, so the gnat will vanish and the sparrow-hawk remain.","A certain king ordered a slavegirl to adorn herself and offer herself to his slaves, so their loyalty could be revealed.","Though the girls action appears sinful outwardly, in reality she is doing the kings work.","The great saints have seen for themselves, not by proof and rote, but face to face and unveiled, that all people — good or evil — are obedient servants of God.","Nothing exists that does not proclaim Gods praise.","Therefore, to the saints, this world itself is the resurrection, since the resurrection means all people serving God and doing no other work but Gods work.","These saints perceive this truth even here below, for even were the veil removed they would not increase in their certainty.","All may be servants, but some have been raised above others in their closeness to God.","To those who are absorbed, all differences are lost.","To those who have not yet arrived, many stages appear between one and another.","Let me cite a parallel.","A gardener planted a tree, and the tree bore fruit.","Surely, this tree that bore fruit is better than a hundred trees that are barren.","It is possible those other trees may never bear at all, since there are many stages of growth where disease might attack.","A pilgrim who reaches the Kaaba is better than the pilgrim who is still travelling in the desert.","The one in the desert fears they may not pass the many landmarks and reach the Kaaba, while the former has already reached their destination.","One certainty is better than a hundred doubts.","The Amir said: Those who have not arrived still have hope.","Rumi answered: What is the hopeful person compared to one who has arrived?","There is a vast difference between fear and attainment.","Why should I speak of such a difference when it is obvious to all?","What I am speaking about is attainment, since there are many differences between the stations of attainment.","It is possible to indicate the various stages of fear and the stations of fear, but the stations of attainment have no indication.","In the world of fear everyone decides what they will devote to honor God.","One person gives through physical efforts, another donates their wealth, another sacrifices their life.","One worships with fasting, another with prayer, another by ten prostrations, another by a hundred.","These stages are very different and can easily be distinguished.","In the same manner there are stages of travel from Konya to Caesarea that are distinct and well-known: One must pass Qaimaz, Uprukh, Sultan, and so forth.","But the stages by sea from Antalya to Alexandria are without landmarks.","The ships captain knows the signs, but they are not shared with landsmen since landsmen cannot understand.","The Amir said: But even speaking about it imparts some benefit.","We may not know everything, yet still we learn a little, and can find out and guess the rest.","Rumi replied: Yes indeed, by God!","Someone sits wakeful through the dark night, thinking of some way to find the day.","Though they do not know how to get there, still, in waiting for daylight, the day approaches.","Another person is travelling by caravan upon a dark night in a storming rain.","They do not know where they have gone, which way they are passing, or what distance they have covered, but when day comes they see the results of that travelling and go on from there.","Whoever labors for the glory of God, though both their eyes are sealed, their labor is not lost.","Even an atoms weight of good is not lost.","Though all within is dark and veiled, and they do not see how far they have progressed, still in the end they will know.","This world is the seedplot of the world to come.","Whatever they sow here, they will reap in the next world.","Jesus laughed a lot.","John wept a lot.","John said to Jesus, You have become exceedingly carefree against all the subtle deceits, that you laugh so much.","Jesus replied, You have become exceedingly unmindful of the subtle, mysterious, wonderful graces and loving kindness of God, that you weep so much.","One of Gods saints was present at this incident.","He asked God, Which of these two has the higher station?","God answered, He who thinks better of Me.","In other words, I come when you think of Me.","Each person has an image and an idea of Me.","Whatever picture he forms of Me, there I am.","I fill that picture where God dwells.","I care nothing for that point of view where God does not exist.","Cleanse your thoughts, O human, for they are My abode and dwelling place.","Now test yourself as to weeping and laughter, fasting and prayer, solitude and company, and the rest.","Which of these is more profitable to you?","Whichever brings you straighter on the road and gains you the greatest advancement, choose that task.","Take counsel from your heart, even though others may disagree.","The truth is within you.","Compare it with what others say.","When they agree, then follow that course.","The physician comes to someone who is sick and questions the inward doctor; for within you there is a doctor, namely your natural temperament, instincts and inclinations.","Therefore the external physician questions it: This food that you ate, how was it?","Was it light?","Was it heavy?","How was your sleep?","From what the inward doctor answers, the external physician makes their prescription.","Therefore the root of the matter is the inward doctor; the patients own response.","When this inner doctor is feeble and its temperament is corrupt, the sick person sees things incorrectly and gives skewed indications.","They say that sugar is bitter, vinegar is sweet.","Therefore they need the external physician to guide them until their own instinct is restored.","After that they consult only their own inward doctor to find the counsel they need.","We have a similar doctor within our spiritual being.","When this higher Self is feeble, our inward senses perceive falsely, and whatever we follow is contrary to the truth.","So the saints are physicians who guide a person until their instinct is restored to its right balance, and their religion and their heart have gathered strength.","Show me things as they truly are.","Humanity is a mighty volume.","Within the people of this world all things are written, but veils and darkness do not allow men and women to read the knowledge within themselves.","The veils and darknesses are those many preoccupations, worldly desires and thoughts of every kind.","Yet, though they are wrapped in darkness and are hidden by so many veils, they can still read something and therefore learn.","Consider when these darknesses and veils are removed, what they will learn then, and what varieties of knowledge they will discover within!","After all, all these trades and professions — tai-loring, building, carpentry, goldsmithery, science, astronomy, medicine and the rest of the worlds countless and innumerable callings — all these were discovered from within by some person, they were not revealed through stones and dirt.","When they say that a raven taught people to bury the dead, even that was due to the reflection of a human being.","Someones own inner urge drove them to learn that.","After all, the instincts of the bird are but a part of humanity, but a part does not command the whole.","After the Amir left, someone said: When the Amir comes, the Master utters mighty words.","The words never stop, because he is a master of words.","Words flow from him without interruption.","Rumi said: If in winter time the trees do not put forth leaves and fruit, people should not think they are not working.","They are continually at work.","Winter is the season of gathering; summer is the season of spending.","Everyone sees the spending, but they do not see the gathering in.","In the same way, a person gives a party and spends all sorts of money on it.","Everyone sees this, but no one sees the gathering in and collecting little by little for the sake of that entertainment.","No one sees any of that.","Yet the ingathering is the root of the matter, for the spending comes out of that income.","Whoever we are in unison with, we communicate with them every moment, even in silence, in absence and presence alike.","Even in battle with others, we are together.","We may strike against others with our fists; still, we are speaking to them and are absorbed in one action with them.","Therefore we are in unison.","Dont become distracted by the fists — in those fists are spiritual gifts.","You dont believe this?","Then open those fists, and see the difference between the sweet joy of unison, and pearls of great price.","Many people speak fine, graceful sayings and lofty wisdom in verse and prose.","The inclination of the Amir towards us is not on account of lofty wisdom, graceful sayings and sermonizing.","Things of that kind are to be found everywhere, and are by no means in short supply.","His loving me and his inclination towards me is not for those things.","He sees something else.","He sees a light transcending what he finds from others.","It is related that a certain king summoned Majnun before him.","What has happened to you.","What has befallen you?","the king inquired.","You have disgraced yourself, forsaken your hearth and home, become wasted and utterly destroyed.","What is Laila?","What beauty is hers?","I will show you many beautiful and lovely girls.","Name your ransom and I will bestow them upon you.","When they were brought to court, Majnun and the lovely girls were duly introduced.","Majnun kept his head cast down, staring in front of him.","Well now, lift up your head and look!","the king commanded.","I am afraid,Majnun replied.","My love for Laila is a drawn sword.","If I raise my head, that blade will strike it off.","Majnun had become immersed in his love for Laila.","Yet, the other girls also had eyes and lips and hair.","What then had he found in Laila to come to such a state?","After the Amir arrived, Rumi said: Ive been longing to call on you.","But, knowing you were busy with the interests of the people, I spared you the trouble.","The Amir answered: This duty has been pressing upon me.","Now that the emergency has ended, from now on I will wait upon you.","Rumi said: There is no difference.","It is all the same thing.","You are so gracious that all things are the same to you.","Since today it is you who are occupied with good deeds and charities, naturally I am able to call on you.","Just now some of us were discussing this question: If a saint, who carries Gods secret jewel [Gods grace], strikes someone, breaking their nose and jaw, who is the wronged party?","Everyone says the one hurt has been wronged, but in reality the wronged person is the saint who is striking the blow.","The one who was punched and had their head broken is the wrongdoer, and the saint is surely the wronged party since they carry Gods jewel.","The saint is consumed in God, and therefore their actions are Gods actions.","We wouldnt call God a wrongdoer.","The Prophet raided, killed and spilled blood, but the unbelievers were the wrongdoers, and Mohammed was wronged.","For example, a westerner lives in the West.","An oriental comes to visit.","The westerner is a stranger to the oriental, but who is the real stranger?","Is not the oriental a stranger to the entire western world?","Still, this whole world is but a house, no more.","Whether we go from this room to that room or from this comer to that comer, are we still not in the same house?","But the saints who possess Gods jewel have left this house.","They have gone beyond.","Mohammed said, Islam began a stranger and will return a stranger as it began.","Yet is not this world the real stranger?","Therefore, when the Prophet was defeated he was the wronged party, and when he defeated his enemies, he was still the wronged party.","For in both cases he was in the right, and the wronged party is the one who is in the right.","Mohammeds heart ached for his prisoners.","To comfort the Prophet, God sent down a revelation saying: O Prophet, say to the prisoners in your hands, If you turn to truth and the righteous way, God will deliver you out of bondage.","He will restore everything you have lost, and much more, including treasures in the world to come.","The Amir asked: When a servant of God performs a service, does the grace and good arise from that action, or is it the gift of God?","Rumi answered: It is the gift of God and the grace of God.","Yet God, out of Its exceeding love gives credit for both the action and the grace to the servant, declaring, Both are yours.","The Amir said: Since God has such love, then everyone who seeks in truth shall find.","Rumi said: But without a guide this does not come to pass.","So, when the Israelites were obedient to Moses, ways were opened up to them even through the sea.","But when they were disobedient, they remained in the wilderness for many years.","The leaders of a given time are charged to secure the welfare of those who are bound to them and are strictly obedient.","For instance, if a group of soldiers follow the orders of their commander, he too cares for their welfare and is duty bound to work at securing it.","But if they are not obedient, how can he be expected to look after their interests?","The mind is the commander of the human body.","So long as the parts of the body surrender to it, all the bodys affairs proceed perfectly, but when they disobey, the whole natural order breaks down.","Havent you seen when a man is drunk, his hands and feet and tongue refuse to obey him?","Then on the following day, when he is sober again, he cries, What have I done?","Why did I do and say such horrible things?","In the same way, a village works together in perfect order only when there is a leader that the villagers follow.","Just as the mind is commander in the midst of the body, so all the different beings who make up humankind, together with their many minds, knowledge, speculation and learning, are the body of humanity, and the saint is the mind in the midst of them.","Now when these people, who are the body, do not follow that mind, their affairs all fall into confusion and conflict.","They must surrender in such a fashion that no matter what the saint does, they accept it without the argument of their own mind.","For often, with their own mind, they cannot understand the saints actions.","Therefore, they must submit to whatever the saint says.","Similarly, when a child is apprenticed to a tailor they must obey whatever they are told to do.","If they are given a patch to sew, they must sew it.","If they are given a hem, they must sew that hem.","If they wish to learn their trade, they must surrender their own desires completely and become submissive to the tailors orders.","The Night of Power is better Than a thousand months."," God offers us divine guidance and care, which are superior to a hundred thousand strivings and struggles.","One tug from God is better than the efforts of all our powers.","That is to say, when divine care intervenes it does the work of a hundred thousand struggles and more.","Straggling is fine, and useful, but what is it compared to Gods guidance and care?","The Amir asked: Does Gods care create struggles?","Rumi answered: Why shouldnt it?","When divine care arrives, struggling begins.","Jesus — what a straggle he made!","Yet John the Baptist recognized that gift while still in Marys womb.","Grace comes first.","Then if, by accident, awareness enters in, this is the fruit of Gods grace — the pure gift of the Lord.","If this were not true, then how could Jesus disciples have received such blessings?","Grace and submission are like a spark of fire that leaps.","First we receive the gift.","But if you add cotton and nurse that spark until it grows, then that is submission.","In the beginning your spark is small and weak.","But once you have nursed that weakling fire it spreads across the world and sets the universe aflame.","The little spark becomes a great and powerful blaze.","Someone said to the Amir: Our Master loves you very much.","Rumi replied: Neither my coming nor my speaking is an indication of my love.","I say whatever comes into me.","If God wills, It makes these few words profitable so they will grow within your heart, bringing great rewards.","If God wills not, if even a hundred thousand words are spoken, they will not lodge in the heart but will pass by and be forgotten.","If a spark of fire lands upon a burnt rag and God wills, that one spark will take and engulf the rag.","If God wills not, a hundred sparks will fall on that tinder and leave no mark.","These words are Gods army.","By Gods authority they open and seize fortresses.","If God commands thousands of horsemen to go and show their faces at such and such a fortress but not to capture it, so it will be.","If It commands a single horseman to seize that fortress, that same single horseman will open the fortress gates and capture it.","God sent a gnat against Nimrod and it destroyed him.","Equal in the eyes of the Gnostic are a penny and a dollar, a lion and a cat.","If God bestows Its blessing, one penny does the work of a thousand dollars and more.","If God withholds Its blessing from a thousand dollars, they cannot do the work of one penny.","So too, if God commissions the cat it destroys the lion, as the gnat destroyed Nimrod.","In short, when we realize that all things are of God, all things become one and the same in our eyes.","I hope, too, that you will hear these words within your hearts, for that would be profitable.","But if a thousand thieves come from outside, they cannot open the door without some fellow-thief inside who can unlock that door.","Speak a thousand words from the outside, still, so long as there is none to answer from within, the door never opens.","So too with a tree — as long as there is no moist thirst in its roots, even if you poured a thousand forrents of water over it, it would accomplish nothing.","First there must be a thirst in its roots for the water to nourish it.","Although the whole world is ablaze with the suns light, unless there is that spark of light within the eye, no one can behold that light.","The root of the matter is the receptiveness within Soul.","Soul is one thing and spirit is another.","Dont you see during sleep how Soul travels abroad?","Spirit remains in the body, keeping it alive, but Soul wanders and is transformed.","When Mohammed said, He who knows his own self knows his Lord, he was speaking of knowing Soul.","If we say that he was speaking of this soul or that soul, that is something very different.","On the other hand, if we explain it as meaning Soul, Itself, the listener may still think we mean one soul, since they do not yet know Soul, Itself.","Mere words cannot convey this spiritual understanding.","Words only reveal what the heart has an ear to hear.","Beyond this world is another world for us.","This world and its delights cater to the animal within us.","These pleasures all fill our animal nature, while our real self slowly dies.","They say, The human being is a rational animal, yet we consist of two things.","Lusts and desires feed our animality in this material world.","But as for our true essence, its food is knowledge, wisdom, and the sight of God.","The animality within us flees away from God, while our spiritual self flees away from this world.","One of you is an unbeliever, And one of you a believer."," Two people are warring within you.","Who shall succeed?","The one that Fortune makes her friend.","This world is a world of winter.","Isnt the name solid given to inanimate things?","These stones and mountains, and the garments worn by this world, are all solidified.","The inner essence of this world can be known by its effects: it is wind and bitter cold.","It is like the winter season when all things are frozen.","What manner of winter is it?","A winter of the mind.","When that divine zephyr comes along, these mountains will begin to melt, and the solidity of this world will dissolve — -just like when the warmth of summer comes along, all the snow and ice turn to water.","On the resurrection day, when that zephyr blows, all things will melt away.","God makes these words an army to surround you and protect you against the enemy, and to be the means of overwhelming the enemy.","For there are enemies — enemies within and enemies without.","Yet they are really nothing — what could they be?","Dont you see how a thousand godless people submit themselves to one leader who becomes their ruler, and that ruler is captive to his own thoughts?","From this it is easy to see the effect of thoughts, since through one feeble and muddled thought thousands of people and worlds are taken prisoner.","Consider then, those whose thoughts are without limitations — what grandeur and splendor they possess, how easily they overwhelm the enemy, and what worlds they subdue!","When I see the limitless wisdom that exists, while armies unending stretch through waste upon waste, all prisoners of one person, and that person the prisoner of a contemptible little thought — where do they all stand compared to thoughts of powerful depths, infinite light, holy, and sublime?","Therefore thoughts have real effects.","In this physical world all living things merely follow and act as instalments of thought.","Without thought they are inanimate and solid.","In the same way, those who understand only the outer form are also solid.","They cannot penetrate the meaning.","They are children, spiritually, and immature even if they are Sufi sheikhs, a hundred years old.","We have returned from the lesser holy war To fight the Greater Holy War."," We all see the battle with outward things and people, and we draw up our forces against these formal adversaries.","We must also draw up our forces against the armies of thoughts, so that desirable thoughts will defeat destructive thoughts and drive them out of the kingdom of our bodies.","This then is indeed the greater struggle and the greater war.","Thoughts have their effect.","They work beyond the influence of the body like the Laws of Nature without any instrument keep the heavens turning.","Therefore philosophers say that thoughts dont require a body.","After all, the body is but an accident.","Why should anyone dwell on an accident?","Reality is like a musk-pod, and this material world and its delights are merely the scent of that musk.","This scent is but transient, a mere accident.","The individual who seeks the musk itself, not content with only the scent, that person is wise.","But whoever is satisfied to possess the scent is a fool.","They have chased after a thing their hand cannot grasp, for the scent is merely an attribute of the musk.","So long as the musk is present in this world, its scent comes to the nostrils.","However, when it leaves this world and crosses that invisible veil, all those who lived by its scent die.","The scent follows the musk, and goes wherever the musk goes.","Fortunate is the person who finds the musk from following its scent and then becomes one with the musk.","They never die, but become an eternal part of the musks essence, imbued with the qualities of the musk.","They will carry its scent to the world, and the world is revived by them.","Only the name of what that person used to be survives, as with a horse or any other animal that has turned to salt in the desert, only the name of horse remains to it.","In effect and in truth it has now become a part of that great ocean of salt.","What good or harm can a name do?","It will not bring it out of its saltiness.","And if you give some other name to this salt-mine, it will not change its taste.","So it behooves us to turn away from the pleasures and delights of this world, that are the rays and reflections of God.","We must not become content with this much, even though this much exists through Gods grace and the radiance of Gods beauty.","Still, it is not eternal.","From Gods viewpoint it is eternal, but from our viewpoint it is not.","It is like the rays of the sun that shine into our house, for though they are rays of the sun and are light, yet they belong to the sun.","When the sun sinks, the light disappears too.","Therefore it behooves us to become the Sun, so the fear of separation cannot cloud our life.","There is giving, and there is knowingness.","Some have generosity and compassion but no true knowledge.","Some have knowledge but no selfsacrifice.","When both are present, that person is blessed and prosperous.","Such a being is truly incomparable.","A stranger is going along a road, but does not know where the road begins or ends, or whether they have wandered the wrong way.","They go on blindly, hoping that perhaps a cock will crow, or some other sign of habitation will appear.","How can such a stranger be compared with those who know the road and travel at ease, not needing sign or waymark?","They have their assigned task clearly before them.","Therefore, knowing exceeds all else.","Mohammed said, The night is long, do not shorten it with your sleep.","The day is bright, do not darken it with your sins.","The night is long for you to voice your inmost secrets and ask for your needs without the distraction of others, without the disturbance of friends and foes.","You are granted peace and privacy as God draws down the veil before the eyes of others, so your acts may be honest, truthful and done wholly for God.","At night the hypocrite is exposed.","The world may be hidden by the dark and shown clearly by the light of day, but at night the hypocrite stands revealed from the sincere.","Since nobody is watching, the hypocrite says, for whose sake should I pretend?","Somebody is watching, but the hypocrites eyes are closed and cannot see that One.","In times of distress everyone calls for help; in times of toothache, and earache, in doubt, fear and insecurity.","In secret everyone calls out hoping that One will hear and grant their requests.","Privately, secretly, people perform good deeds to ward off weakness and restore their strength, trusting that Life will accept their gifts and efforts.","When they are restored to health and peace of mind, then suddenly their faith leaves, and the phantom of anxiety soon returns.","O God, they cry again, we were in such a terrible state when, with all sincerity, we called upon you from our prison comer.","For a hundred prayers you granted our requests.","Now, freed of the prison, we are still as much in need.","Bring us out of this world of darkness into that world of the prophets, the world of light.","Why can freedom not come without prisons and pain?","A thousand desires fill us, both good and deceitful, and the conflict of these phantoms brings a thousand fortures that leave us weary.","Where is that sure faith that burns up all phantoms?","God answers, The seeker of pleasure in you is your enemy and My enemy.","Do not take your enemy and My enemy for a friend."," When your pleasure-seeking self is imprisoned, filled with trouble and pain, then your freedom arrives and gathers strength.","A thousand times you have proved that freedom comes to you out of toothache, headache and fear.","Why then are you chained to bodily comfort?","Why are you always occupied with tending the flesh?","Do not forget the end of that thread: unravel those bodily passions till you have attained your eternal passion, and find freedom from the prison of darkness.","Sheikh Ibrahim said: Whenever Saif-al-Din Farrukh ordered someone to be given a beating, he would immediately occupy himself until the beating was over, so that no one could intercede.","Rumi said: Whatever you see in this world corresponds exactly with what is in the world beyond.","All these realities are samples of the other Reality.","Whatever exists in this world has come from there.","The bald man of Baalbek carried on his head trays and samples of various herbs — a pinch of pepper, a pinch of mastic, a pinch from every heap.","The heaps were infinite, but there was no room on his tray for more.","People are like the bald man of Baalbek, they are loaded with pinches and pieces out of the treasuries of God, some known and some hidden — a piece of hearing, a piece of speech, a piece of reason, a piece of generosity, a piece of knowledge.","For this reason our work is always a reflection of God.","There are beings who are hawkers of God.","Night and day they fill trays.","By day you spend away your portion to make your living, by night these beings replenish your tray.","For instance, in the other world there are sights and visions of many kinds.","A sample of those has been sent to you to see in this world.","Sight is not limited to this world only, but the human body cannot bear more than this.","Thousands of people, generation after generation, have come and filled themselves from that Sea, returning again and again.","That source is infinite.","The longer we stay upon that Infinite Sea, the colder our heart grows for this world of samples.","This world is coined in that Mint and must return to that Mint again.","All our parts have issued from that Mint, are samples of that Mint, and must return again — small and great, for all living creatures.","Yet upon the tray of this world life becomes visible; without the tray it is not visible.","That infinite world is a subtle world and does not reveal itself openly — yet look how wonderfully it makes its appearance here!","Dont you see how the spring breeze becomes visible in the trees and grasses, the rose-beds and sweet herbs?","Through the swaying of fields and flowers you witness the beauty of spring.","But when you look upon the breeze itself, you see nothing.","This isnt because the beauty of those rose-beds are outside the reality of the breeze, for the spring breeze contains images of swaying rose-beds and sweet herbs, but those images are subtle and invisible.","Only through some medium are they revealed out of their subtlety.","Likewise in the human being these qualities are hidden and only become manifest through an inward or outward medium; one person through speech, another through work, another during times of war or peace.","You cannot see these attributes within yourself — look and you will find nothing there — so you believe yourself empty of these infinite attributes.","These attributes do not come forth and change you into something else from what you were.","Rather, these qualities are hidden in you, like the water in the sea.","Water cannot leave the sea except through the suns heat in the form of a cloud; it cannot become visible except in a wave.","Your wave is a commotion visible within you, but so long as the sea is still, you see nothing.","Your body is on the shore of the sea, and Soul is a part of the ocean itself.","Do you not see how many fishes, snakes, birds, and creatures of all kinds come forth and show themselves, and then return to the sea?","Your attributes such as patience, friendship, loyalty and the rest, come forth from this sea.","These qualities are subtle lovers of God.","You can only glimpse them through the medium of the tongue.","But because of their subtlety, without speech they are naked and they retreat back out of sight into the arms of God.","Within people there is a longing and a desire such that, even if a hundred thousand worlds were theirs to own, still they would find no rest or comfort.","They try every trade and craft, studying astronomy, medicine and every other subject, but they reach no completion, for they have not found their true desire.","Poets call the Beloved hearts ease, because there the heart finds ease.","How can we find peace and rest in anything but the Beloved?","All these pleasures and pursuits are like a ladder.","The rungs of a ladder are not a place to make ones home; they are for passing by.","Fortunate are those who learn this.","The long road becomes short for them, and they do not waste their lives upon the steps.","Someone asked: The Mongols have seized property by force, and from time to time they give this property back to us.","This is a strange situation.","Is it lawful to accept this property?","What is your ruling?","Rumi answered: Whatever the Mongols seize and give up returns into the grasp and treasury of God.","For example, when you fill a jug or a barrel from the river and carry it away, that becomes your property.","So long as it is in the jug or barrel, nobody has the right to interfere.","Whoever takes the jug without permission is guilty of theft.","But once they pour the water back into the river, it passes out of ownership and is lawful for anyone to take once again.","So our property is unlawful to them, while their property is lawful to us since by their giving it up they have returned it to the treasury of God.","Someone said: When the Mongols first came to these parts they were naked and bare.","They rode on bullocks and their weapons were made of wood.","Now they are sleek and well-fed, they have splendid Arab horses and carry fine arms.","Rumi said: When they were desperate and weak and had no strength, God helped them and answered their prayer.","Now, when they are so powerful and mighty, God is destroying them with the comforts of the feeblest, so they will realize it was through Gods bounty and support that they captured the world, and not by their own force and power.","They used to live in a wilderness, far from civilization, without means, poor, naked and needy.","By chance, some of them came to trade in the territory of the Khvarizmshah.","They began to buy and sell, purchasing muslin to clothe their bodies.","The Khvarizmshah stopped them, ordering them to be put to death, and forcing payment from the rest of them.","The Mongols went humbly before their king, saying, They have killed us.","Their king asked for ten days, and then entered a deep cave where he fasted and humbled himself.","On the tenth day a proclamation came from God, I have accepted your supplication.","Come forth!","Wherever you go, you shall be victorious.","So it was.","When they came forth, by Gods command they won the victory and captured the world.","Someone said: The Mongols also believe in the resurrection and say that there will be a judgement.","Rumi said: They lie, desiring to be accepted by Muslims.","If they really believe in the resurrection, where is the evidence to prove it?","The sins, wrongs and evils they commit are like snow and ice piled together as high as a mountain.","When thoughts of the resurrection come to us, like the sun it melts those snows of sinfulness as the sun in the heaven melts anything hard.","How can the summer sun come and leave the snow and ice of winter intact?","Seeing their snow and ice piled heap upon heap is proof that the sun has not shone upon them.","Although God has promised that all good and evil will be rewarded justly on the last day, yet a sample of this comes to pass every moment and in every instant.","If happiness enters into someones heart, that is his or her reward for making another happy.","If they become sorrowful, it is because they have brought sorrow to another.","These are gifts from the other world and tokens of that day of rewards, so that by these little things we may come to understand those great matters, just as a handful of com is offered as a token of the whole heap.","The Prophet, for all his majesty and greatness, one night felt pain in his hand.","It was revealed to him that this pain was the effect of a pain in the hands of Abbas.","For he had taken Abbas captive and had bound his hands together with all the prisoners.","Although the tying of his hands was done at Gods order, still the Prophet had to suffer.","These troubles and depressions that come to you are the effect of some injury and wrong you have committed.","Even if you cannot remember in detail what you have done, still from the results you can know the deed.","You may not remember whether it came from your own negligence or ignorance, or because others swayed you into wrongful action.","But look at the results: how much did you fall from grace, or how much has your heart expanded?","Certainly a fall from grace is the response of disobedience to God, and expansion of the heart is the reward of obedience.","Why, the Prophet himself was rebuked because he turned a ring on his finger.","He was told, We did not create you for idleness and play.","From this decide for yourself whether your day is passed in obedience or disobedience.","Moses was occupied with the affairs of his people.","Although he was at Gods command and completely served God, yet one side of him was occupied with humanity for the general good.","Khadir was occupied with God completely; he hid himself from the sight of others.","Mohammed was occupied at first wholly with God, then he was told, Call the people.","Counsel them and reform them.","Mohammed wept and lamented, saying, Oh, my Lord, what sin have I committed?","Why do you drive me from Your presence?","I have no desire for this world.","God said to him, Mohammed, do not despair, I will not abandon you.","Even in the midst of others you shall be with Me.","When you are occupied with people, not one hair of the head of this hour with Me, not one, will be taken from you.","In whatever work you are engaged, you will be in very union with Me.","Someone asked: The eternal decrees that God has predestined, do they ever change?","Rumi answered: How could God say, Do evil to find good?","If someone sows wheat, can they gather barley?","Or if they sow barley, will they gather wheat?","That is impossible.","All the saints and prophets have said that good is the reward of good, evil the reward of evil.","And whoever does an atoms weight of goodshall see it, And whoever does an atoms weight of evilshall see it.","Someone interjected: But we see wicked people turn virtuous, and virtuous people turn wicked.","Rumi answered: Well, those wicked men and women did some good, or thought good things, which brought them virtue.","And those virtuous people did some evil act, or contemplated evil things, turning them wicked.","Someone asked: What is the meaning of the saying, Blessings upon the Prophet","Rumi answered: It means that our acts of adoration, service and worship do not belong to us, they come from God.","Just like the season of spring brings the planting of seeds, and jaunts into the wilderness.","They are the gift and bounty of spring.","The people of this world see secondary causes and think they are the origin of everything.","Gods saints see the actualities as they are created and come into being.","Secondary causes are only a veil to occupy the common peo-ple.God promised Zachariah, I will give you a son.","Zachariah cried, I am an old man, and my wife is old.","My instrument of lust has become feeble, and my wife can no longer conceive.","Lord, how can a son be bom?","The answer came, Take heed Zachariah!","You have lost the clue.","I have shown you a hundred thousand times that actualities have no causes.","This very moment, I could produce out of you a hundred thousand sons without a wife and without pregnancy.","Indeed, if I make the sign, a whole people will come forth, completely formed and grown.","Did I not bring you into being in the world of spirits without a mother or father?","Why do you forget these things?","The rank and substance of the prophets and saints and the many states of humanity can be set forth in a parable: Slaves are brought out of the heathen lands into the realm of Muslimdom, where they are sold.","Some are brought at the age of five years, some are ten, and some are fifteen years old.","Those who were brought as children, having been nurtured for many years amongst Muslims, completely forget their homeland.","No trace of it remains in their memory.","Those brought a little older remember a little.","Those much older remember much more.","In the world beyond, all are in the Presence of God.","The food and sustenance there is the speech of God, without letters and without sounds.","Those who are brought into this world as children, when they hear that Speech, remember nothing of their former state and see themselves as strangers to that Speech.","They are veiled from God, being wholly sunk in forgetfulness.","Some remember a little bit, and the longing and yearning for the other side is quickened in them.","They seek out Truth.","They are the believers.","Some, when they hear that Speech, the Presence of God becomes manifest before their eyes, even as it was long ago.","The veils are entirely removed, and they are joined in that union.","These are the prophets and the saints.","Now I say this to you earnestly, when the brides of heavenly truth show their faces within you and their secrets are revealed, beware, do not tell this to strangers.","Do not describe what you have witnessed to others, and do not tell everyone these words of mine.","Do not impart wisdom to those not worthy, lest you do wisdom wrong.","And, do not withhold from the worthy, lest you do them wrong.","If a fair and adorable lover surrenders to you privately in your house, saying, Show me to no one, for I belong to you, it would never be proper for you to parade her in the bazaars and to call out, Come and see this beauty!","That would never be agreeable to such an adorable one.","She would be enraged against you.God has made these words unlawful to some.","Even so, dwellers in Hell cry out to the dwellers in Paradise, saying, Where is your generosity and your humanity?","Out of those gifts and bounties that God has given to you, out of charity and common kindness if you sprinkle just a little upon us, could that be so difficult?","We are burning and melting in this fire.","Out of those fruits, or out of those clear waters of Paradise, if you sprinkle a drop or two upon our souls, what would that be?","The dwellers in Paradise answer, God has forbidden that to you.","The seed of this bliss came from our earlier deeds.","Since you did not sow and cultivate with faith, sincerity and good works, what should you gather here?","Even if out of generosity we should share with you, since it is not your reward it would bum your throats and stick in your gul-lets.","A crowd of hypocrites and strangers came into the presence of Mohammed.","They began to talk about mysteries and praised the Prophet.","Mohammed turned to his companions and said, Cover up your vessels.","He meant, Conceal wisdom from strangers, and in their presence stop up your mouths and tongues, for they are mice and not worthy of this wisdom and grace.","The Amir who has just left our company — though he did not understand in detail what we were saying, yet he realizes in general that we were calling him to God.","I take the wagging of his head, his smile of affection and his flush of passion as a sign of his understanding.","If people from the country come into the city and hear the call to prayer, though they do not know in detail the meaning of the call, still they understand its purpose.","Rumi said: Whoever is loved is beautiful, but this does-nt mean that whoever is beautiful is loved.","There are girls more beautiful than Laila, they used to tell Majnun.","Let us bring some to you.I do not love Laila for her form,Majnun would reply.","Laila is like a cup in my hand.","I drink wine from that cup.","I am in love with that wine.","You only have eyes for the goblet and do not know the wine.","A golden goblet studded with precious stones, but containing only vinegar, what use is that to me?","An old broken gourd with wine is better in my eyes than a hundred goblets of gold.","A person must be moved with passion and yearning for them to tell the wine from the cup.","This is the same as someone who is hungry, who hasnt eaten for ten days, and another who has eaten five times a day.","Both see a loaf of bread.","The full one sees only more food, but the hungry person sees life, itself.","To the hungry, this bread is a goblet, and the life it brings is wine.","Such wine cannot be known except through hunger and yearning.","Acquire this appetite so you will not only see the appearances of form, but will find the Beloved everywhere.","The forms of this world are cups.","Science, art and knowledge are inscriptions upon the cup.","When the cup is broken, those inscriptions disappear.","Therefore, those who drink the wine see the eternal reality, the deeds of holiness...","Anyone asking a question must first come to the awareness that their knowledge is incomplete, and secondly that there is wisdom they know nothing about.","Hence, the saying, Asking is half of knowing.","But there must always be one in this world who knows.","Everyone looks to someone, because ultimately we are looking for God.","But there must always be one who can distinguish those who are hitting the mark from those who have been struck by the arrow of someone elses bow.","If you hear words coming through a wall, you know that wall isnt speaking and that voice belongs to someone else.","The saints are like this.","They have died before death, and have become like doors and walls.","Not even a hairs tip of separate existence remains in them.","In the hands of Reality, they are shields — but the shield doesnt move under its own power.","Thus the saints say, I am the Truth, meaning, I am nothing at all, I move by the Hand of God.","Look upon such shields as God.","Do not take up violence against God.","Striking blows against such shields are just like declaring war against God, Itself.","Every saint is Gods proof.","The rank and station of men and women is determined by how they treat the saint.","If they are hostile to the saint, they are acting hostile against God.","If they befriend the saint, they have made friendship with God.","Whoever has seen them has seen Me.","Whoever finds them has found Me."," Gods saints are familiar with the secrets of His refuge.","They have become intimate with the Divine Mysteries that none but the purified shall touch.","If they turn their backs on the tomb of a great saint, it is not out of disobedience or neglect.","They have turned their faces toward that saints essence, for these words spoken here are their essence.","There is no harm in turning away from the body to face the soul.","It is a custom of mine that I want no heart to become distressed through me.","During our meetings, sometimes a great multitude thrust themselves upon me and some of my friends try to fend them off.","That disturbs me.","I have said a hundred times, Say nothing on my account.","I am content with that.","I care to such a degree that when such friends come to me, I dread the thought of boring them, so I speak poetry for their enjoyment.","Otherwise, what do I care about poetry?","By God, I care nothing for poetry.","There is nothing worse in my eyes.","To me, it is like the cook who plunges his hand into tripe, cleaning it out for the sake of a guests appetite.","A merchant searches to see what products are needed in their city, and what the people want to buy.","Then they buy and sell those goods and services, even if they are the lowest of things in their eyes.","I have studied many sciences and taken pains to offer fine, rare and precious things to the scholars and researchers, the clever ones and the deep thinkers who come to me.","God has willed this.","He gathered to me all those sciences, and assembled here all those pains, so I woidd become occupied with this work.","What can I do?","In my own country, and amongst my own people, there is nothing more shameful than poetry.","If I had remained there, I would have lived in harmony with their temperament.","I would have practiced what they love, such as giving lectures, composing books and preaching.","The Amir said: The root of the matter is action.","Rumi said: Where are such people of action, so that I can teach them action?","But now look how you cock your ears, seeking after words instead of action.","If I were to stop speaking now, you would become upset.","Become a seeker of action, so that I can show you action!","I am looking all over the world for students of action so that I can teach action.","I am looking all over the world for anyone who knows action, but I find no student of action — only of words, and so I occupy myself with words.","What do you know of action?","Action is only known through action.","There is not one traveler upon this road — it is empty — so how will anyone see if we are on the true path of action?","After all, prayer and fasting are not action; these are forms of action.","Action is an inward reality.","From the time of Adam to the time of Mohammed, prayer and fasting have changed their form, but action is still the same.","Action is not what people think it is.","People believe action is this outward show.","But if a hypocrite performs only the form of action, such as prayer or fasting, it gains them nothing, since the sincere desire for true action was not present.","The secret principle of all things is speech and words.","You do not yet know the true knowledge of speech and words, therefore you consider them unimportant.","However, speech is fruit from the tree of action, for words are bom of action.","God created the world by a word.","You may have faith in your heart, but unless you share it through words, it is worth nothing.","When you say, In this present age words are of no account, you say this with words, do you not?","If words are of no account, then why do we hear you say this with words?","Someone asked: When we do a good deed, if we have hopes and expectations of a good reward from God, does that harm us?","Rumi answered: By God, we must always have hope.","Faith, itself, consists of fear and hope.","Someone once asked me, Hope itself is good, but what is this fear?","I said, Show me a fear without hope, or a hope without fear.","The two are inseparable.","For example, a farmer plants wheat.","Naturally he hopes that wheat will grow.","At the same time he is afraid some blight or drought may destroy it.","So, there is no hope without fear, or fear without hope.","Now, when we hope expectantly for a reward, we will surely work with greater effort.","Expectation becomes our wings, and the stronger our wings the farther the flight.","If, on the other hand we lose hope, we become lazy and of no value to anyone.","A sick person will take bitter medicine and give up ten sweet pleasures, but if they have no hope for health, why would they endure this?","We are a mixture of animal and speech.","If we do not speak outwardly, we still speak inwardly — we are constantly speaking.","We are like a river in which clay is mixed; the pure water is our speech, while the clay is our animality.","But the clay in us is an accident.","Do you not see how those pieces of clay have crumbled and rotted away, while mankinds speech, poetry and sciences, both bad and good have remained?","The man or woman of heart is a universe.","When you have seen them, you have seen all.","All game is in the belly of the wild ass.","All creatures in this world are contained in the man and woman of heart.","Good and evil, the dervishes may be, Whoever is not so, no dervishes are they.","Once you have seen one who is the whole, surely you have seen the whole world.","Whoever you see after is a mere repetition.","That persons speech is contained in the words of the whole.","Once you have heard their words, every word you hear thereafter is an echo.","Whoever beholds such a one, in any place.","Has seen all men and women, all time and space.","As the poet says: You are the true transcription Of the Archetype Divine.","A glass through which the Sun s Own loveliness does shine.","Within, or without, Wherever it may lie, Accept every desire, And declare,  Tis I!","The Amir of Rum said: The unbelievers used to worship and bow down to idols.","Now we are doing the selfsame thing.","We go and bow down and wait upon the Mongols, and yet we consider ourselves Muslims.","We have many other idols in our heart too, such as greed, passion, temper, envy, and we are obedient to all of them.","So we act in the very same way as the unbelievers, both outwardly and inwardly, and we consider ourselves Muslims!","Rumi answered: But here is something different; it enters your thoughts that this conduct is evil and utterly detestable.","The eye of your heart has seen something incomparably greater that shows up this behavior as vile and hideous.","Brackish water shows its brackishness to one who has tasted sweet water, and things are made clear by their opposites.","So God has implanted in Soul the light of faith to see these things as hideous.","Confronted by beauty, this appears ugly.","Yet others are not affected this way, they are perfectly happy in their existing state, saying, This is absolutely fine.","God will grant you your hearts desire — where your ambition is, that will be yours.","The bird flies with its wings, the believers fly with their aspiration.","There are three kinds of creatures.","First there are angels, who are pure spiritual conscience.","Worship, service and the remembrance of God are their nature and their food.","They eat and live upon that essence.","Like fish in the water, their mattress and pillow are the water.","Angels are pure and free of lust, so what favor do they gain by not yielding to such desires?","Since they are free of these things, they have no struggle against them.","If they obey Gods will it is not counted as obedience, for this is their nature, and they cannot be otherwise.","Second are the beasts who are pure sensuality, having no spiritual conscience to restrain them.","They too are under no burden of obligation.","Lastly, there remains the poor human being, who is a compound of spiritual conscience and sensuality.","We are half angel, half beast.","Half snake, half fish.","The fish draws us toward water, the snake toward the earth.","We are forever in battle.","If our spiritual conscience overcomes our sensuality, we are higher than the angels.","If our sensuality overcomes our spiritual conscience, we are lower than the beasts.","The angel is saved through knowledge, The animal — through ignorance.","Between the two struggle the people of this world.","Now, some have followed their spiritual conscience so faithfully that they have become entirely angels and pure Light.","They are the prophets and the saints.","They are freed of fear and hope.","In some, lust has overcome their spiritual conscience so entirely that they have taken on the status of animals.","Some are still struggling.","These last are the people who feel within themselves an agony and anguish, a sorrow and a longing.","They are not satisfied with their lives.","These are the believers.","The saints are waiting to bring them to their own station, to make them like themselves, just as the satans, too, are waiting to draw them to the lowest of the low.","When Gods help comes through victory, And you see people Submitting to His Will in throngs, Then fill yourself with the presence of the Lord, And seek His forgiveness; For God turns to men and women again.","Now, commentators offer an outward interpretation to the above Sura, from the Koran, as follows: Mohammed had the dream, I will make all the world Muslims and bring them to the path of God.","When he saw his death approaching he cried, Ah, didnt I come into this life to call the people to God?","God answered, Do not grieve.","In that very hour when you pass away, provinces and cities which you would conquer by armies and by the sword I will convert to obedience and to the faith, every one of them without armies.","The sign of this will come at the end when you are dying, you will see people entering in throngs and becoming Muslims.","When this sign comes, know that the time for your departure has arrived.","Then give praise, and seek forgiveness.","However, there is an inward meaning to this Sura as well: People think they can drive away evil by great effort and striving.","After struggling and exhausting all their powers and means, they fall into despair.","Then God says to them: You thought you could achieve this goal through your own power, action and work.","This is the law I have laid down: Whatever you possess, spend it in Our name.","Then Our grace will supervene.","You must journey upon this infinite road with the feeble hands and feet that you possess.","We know well that with feet so feeble you can never accomplish this journey.","Indeed, in a hundred thousand years you will not be able to accomplish a single stage of this journey.","But even as you collapse and fall, with no strength left to struggle farther, then Our loving breath will carry you on.","Even a child, so long as it is a suckling, is carried in the arms, but when it is grown it is set free to walk.","Now in this hour when your powers have left you, when your own means fail, behold Our graces, Our gifts and Our love.","You will not witness even an atom of such blessings after a hundred thousand strivings.","I do not love or bow down to the Amir on account of worldly considerations, for his rank, learning or achievements.","Others love him for those reasons, not seeing the Amirs face, but only his back.","The Amir is like a mirror with precious pearls on its back, with gold inlaid.","Those who love gold and pearls look at the back of the mirror, but those who love life always look upon the mirror, and love the mirror for itself.","They do not grow weary of the fair beauty they see.","But those with a hideous face full of blemishes see in the mirror only ugliness.","They quickly turn the mirror and look for those precious stones.","Yet what harm is done to the face of the mirror if its back is studded with a thousand kinds of engravings and precious stones?","Things are made clear by their opposite.","It is impossible to know anything without its opposite, yet God has no opposite.","I was a hidden treasure,God says, and I wanted to be known.","So It created this world of darkness for Its Light to become visible.","So, too, It manifested the prophets and the saints, saying, Go forth with My Attributes into My creation.","They are the theater for the Light of God, where friend may be disclosed from foe, and brother from stranger.","The struggles of the saints reveals Gods opposite, even though It has none.","Through persecution and opposition, the saints become known and admired.","With their mouths, the unbelievers try to extinguish the Light of God.","But God will perfect His Light through their adversity.","God chastises some people through wealth, gold and rulership, for Soul flees from such possessions.","Shams saw a prince riding in Arabia, on his brow the illumination of the prophets and saints.","Shams said, Glory be to God who chastises His servants by means of affluence!","Someone said: Ibn Muqri recites the Koran correctly.","Rumi said: Yes, he recites the form of the Koran correctly, but he has no knowledge of its meaning.","This is proven by the fact that when he is questioned for its meaning, he cannot answer.","He recites blindly.","He is like a man who holds an old, tattered sable in his hand; he is offered a newer, finer sable, but he refuses it.","So we can see that he doesnt know what sable really is.","Someone told him that this is sable, and he blindly accepted it.","It is like children playing with walnuts.","Offer them the nut itself, or the oil of the walnut, and they will refuse it, saying, The walnut is what we spin on the table.","This doesnt spin.","Gods treasuries are many, and Gods sciences are many.","If he recites this Koran with knowledge, why does he reject the other eternal Koran?","I once explained to a Koran-teacher: The Koran says, If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would be spent before the Words of my Lord are spent.","Now, with fifty drams of ink one can copy the whole of this Koran.","Therefore, the Koran is only a symbol of Gods knowledge and all the knowledge belonging to God.","An apothecary puts a pinch of medicine in a piece of paper.","You wouldnt say, The whole of the apothecarys shop is in this paper.","That would be foolishness.","After all, in the time of Moses and Jesus and the other prophets, the Koran existed.","Gods speech existed, but it was not in Arabic.","I explained this to the Koran-teacher in this way, but I could see that it made no impression so I let him go.","It is related that during the time of the Prophet anyone who knew one Sura by heart, or half a Sura, was called a great person and pointed out, They have a Sura by heart, since in that day they devoured the Koran.","To devour a loaf of bread, or two loafs, is certainly a great accomplishment.","But people who put bread in their mouths without chewing it and spit it out again can devour thousands of tons in that way.","Still this is a good thing.","God has sealed the eyes of some people so they can cultivate this present world.","If no one were blind to the other world, this world would be empty.","It is this blindness that gives rise to culture and progress.","Consider children, how they grow up recklessly and become tall, but when their judgement reaches maturity they stop growing.","So the cause and reason for civilization is blindness, and the cause of devastation is sight.","What I am saying is motivated by one of two things: Either I speak out of envy, or I speak with compassion.","God forbid that it should be envy!","It is stupid to envy even those who are worthy of envy, then how can we envy one who is not worthy?","No, I speak out of great compassion and mercy, for I wish to draw you into the true meaning.","A story is told of a man on the way to the pilgrimage who collapsed in the desert, overcome by thirst.","Suddenly he saw in the distance a small and tattered tent.","He struggled there, and seeing a young girl, he cried aloud, I am a guest!","I have attained my goal!","Saying this, he sat down and asked for water.","She brought him water that was hotter than fire and more brackish than salt, and from lip to throat it burned every part.","The man, out of extreme compassion, addressed the woman.","I am indebted to you for what relief you have given me, he said.","Compassion has welled up within me.","Listen to what I say to you.","Behold, Baghdad is nearby, and Kufa and Wasit and the rest.","There you will find plenty of sweet, cool water, foods of various kinds, baths, luxuries, rich delights.","And he described the pleasures of those cities.","A moment later the Bedouin came on the scene who was the womans husband.","He had caught a few brace of desert rats, which he told the woman to cook.","They offered some to the guest, who being in such desperate straits ate them.","After that, in the middle of the night, the guest slept outside the tent.","The woman spoke to her husband.","Did you hear all the stories our guest had to tell?","And she repeated to her husband the guests entire account.","Dont listen to these things, the Bedouin answered.","There are many envious people in the world.","When they see others living a life of ease and abundance, they envy them and want to send them wandering away to deprive them of their fortune.","So it is with many people.","When anyone out of pure compassion offers them a piece of advice, they see it as envy.","But if there are roots in a person, in the end they will turn their face to the truth.","If, since the day of the Primordial Covenant a drop has been sprinkled upon them, in the end that drop will deliver them out of all confusion and misery.","Come then!","How long will you be remote from us and estranged?","How long locked up in confusion and sadness?","And what should we say to people who have never heard stories like this before, even from their own teacher?","Since greatness never graced their forebears, They cannot bear to hear the great ones praised.","Although facing the truth is not attractive at first, the longer one follows it the sweeter it becomes.","This is the opposite of outward forms that charm us at first, but the longer you sit with them thinking they are all there is, the colder you become.","What is the form of the Koran compared with its meaning?","Examine a man or woman: what is their form compared with their meaning?","If the sense of that person departs, we wouldnt let them loose in our house for one moment.","Our Master, Shams, once told this story: A great caravan was on its way to a distant city.","Along the way they found a certain place with no sign of habitation or water.","Suddenly they came upon a well with no bucket.","So they took a kettle and some rope and lowered this kettle into the well.","They drew up the rope, but the kettle broke away.","They sent down another, but it broke away too.","After that they tied people from the caravan with a rope and lowered them down into the well, but they disappeared as well.","Now there was a man of great heart present.","He said, I will go down.","They lowered him down.","He was nearly to the bottom of the well when a terrible black creature suddenly appeared.","I will never escape, the man thought.","But at least let me keep my wits about me and not lose my senses, so that I can see what is going to happen.","Dont make a long story of it, the black creature said.","Youre my prisoner.","You wont escape unless you give me the right answer.","Nothing else will save you.","Ask on, said the man.","Where is the best place?","the creature asked.","I am a prisoner and helpless, the man reflected.","If I say Baghdad or some other place, I might insult his own hometown.","Then he spoke aloud, The best place to live is wherever we feel at home.","If that is in the bowels of the earth, then thats the best place.","If its in a mouse hole, then thats the best place.","Well said, well said!","cried the creature.","Youve escaped.","Youre one in a million.","Now Ive let you go, and set free the others on account of your blessing.","From this time forward Ill shed no more blood.","I bestow this gift on all the people of the world out of love for you.","Then he gave the people of the caravan water to satisfy their needs.","The purpose of this story is contained in its inner meaning.","We can tell the same meaning in another form, but the lovers of traditional forms will accept this version.","It is difficult to speak with them.","If we speak these very same words in another parable they will not listen.","Rumi said: Someone said to Taj al-Din Qubai, These doctors of divinity live amongst us and deprive the people of their religious beliefs.","Taj al-Din Qubai answered, They do not live amongst us and take away our beliefs.","God forbid they could ever be one of us.","If you put a golden collar on a dog, do you call it a hunting dog because of that collar?","The quality of being a hunting dog is something specific in the animal, whether it wears a collar of gold or wool.","No one becomes a scholar by virtue of robe and turban.","Scholarship is a virtue in its very essence, and whether that virtue is clothed in tunic or overcoat, it makes no difference.","Thus, in Mohammeds time, the hypocrites used to put on prayer-robes to lure Muslims away from the Faith.","How could they lead astray Muslims until they dressed up as Muslims, themselves?","If a Christian or a Jew criticized Islam, who would listen to them?","Woe to those that pray Yet do not listen to their own prayers, Or to those who make big displays But for others have no care."," But these are merely words.","You have caught that Light but still have not found humanity.","Seek humanity: that is your true purpose.","The rest is mere long-windedness.","When words are elaborately decorated, their purpose is forgotten.","A certain greengrocer was in love with a woman, and he sent messages by the ladys maid.","I am like this, I am like that.","I am in love, I am on fire.","I find no peace.","I am cruelly treated.","I was like this yesterday.","Last night such and such happened to me.","And he recited long, long stories.","The maid came into the ladys presence and addressed her as follows: The greengrocer sends you greetings and says, Come, so that I may do this and that to you.","So coldly?","the lady asked.","He spoke at great length, answered the maid.","But that was his purpose.","The purpose is the root of the matter; the rest is merely a headache.","Rumi said: Night and day you are at war, attempting to reform the character of the opposite sex, to cleanse their impurity and to correct their faults.","It is better to cleanse yourself through them than trying to cleanse them through yourself.","Reform yourself by means of them.","Go to them and accept whatever they may say, even if from your viewpoint their words sound absurd or unfair.","It was on account of this truth that Mohammed said, There is no monkhood in Islam.","The way of monks is solitude, dwelling in mountains, men not living with women, and giving up the world.","God showed the Prophet a straight and hidden way.","What is that way?","Marriage, so that we can endure the trials of living with the opposite sex, to listen to their demands, for them to ride roughshod over us, and so in this way to refine our own character.","By enduring and putting up with the tyranny of your spouse it is as though you rub off your own impurity on them.","Your character becomes good through forbearance; their character becomes bad through domineering and aggression.","Once you have realized this, make yourself clean.","Know that they are like a garment; in them you can cleanse your own impurities and become clean yourself.","Rid yourself of pride, envy and jealousy, until you experience pleasure in struggling and enduring.","Through their demands discover spiritual joy.","After that, you will endure such straggles, and you will not run from oppression, since you will see the advantages they bring to you.","It is related that Mohammed returned with his Companions from a raid, one night.","He told them to beat the drum saying, Tonight we will sleep at the gate of the city, and enter tomorrow.","They asked, Messenger of God, why dont we return to our homes immediately?","He said, You might see your wives in bed with strange men.","You would be hurt, and a commotion would arise.","One of the Companions did not hear; he entered and found his wife with a stranger.","The way of the Prophet is this: It is necessary to endure pain to help rid ourselves of selfishness, jealousy and pride.","To experience the pain of our spouses extravagant desires, the pain of unfair burdens, and a hundred thousand other pains beyond all bounds, so the spiritual path can become clear.","The way of Jesus was wrestling with solitude and not gratifying lust.","The way of Mohammed is to endure the oppression and agonies inflicted by men and women upon each other.","If you cannot go by the Mohammedan way, at least go by the way of Jesus, so you will not remain completely outside the spiritual path.","If you have the serenity to endure a hundred buffets, seeing the fruits and harvest that come through them, or believing in your hidden heart, Though in this hour I see no harvest of these sufferings, in the end I will reach the treasures, you will reach the treasuries, yes, and more than you ever desired and hoped.","If these words have no effect upon you now, after a while when you become maturer they will leave a great impression.","This is the difference between talking with your spouse and a friend.","When you speak to your mate, they remain the same and will not change their ways due to anything you say.","You words have no affect on them, indeed they become more determined.","For instance, take a loaf of bread, put it under your arm, and deny it to others, saying, I will not give this to anyone.","Give it?","Why, I wont even show it.","Even if that loaf had been cast away and the dogs would not eat it because bread is so plentiful and cheap — yet the moment you begin to refuse it, everybody is after it and sets their hearts on it, pleading and protesting, We want to see that bread which you refuse and keep hidden.","Especially if you keep it hidden for a year, insisting emphatically that you will neither give it away nor show it, their eagerness for the loaf passes all bounds, since, People are passionate for whatever they are denied.","The more you tell your spouse, Keep yourself hidden, the greater their itch to flirt and show themselves.","And through their being hidden, the opposite sex becomes more eager for them.","So there you sit in the middle, augmenting eagerness on both sides, and you think of yourself as a reformer!","Why, that is the very essence of corruption.","If they have in them the natural quality not to do evil, whether you prevent them or not, they will proceed according to their good temperament and pure constitution.","So rest assured, and dont worry.","If they are the opposite, they will still go their own way; trying to stop them in reality does nothing but increase their eagerness.","Someone said: We heard some men saying, We saw Shams-i-Tabriz, we really saw him.","Rumi said: Fools, where did they see him?","Would you listen to someone who cannot see a camel on the roof of their own house, if they come along and say, I found a needle in the field and threaded it.","That is a fine story, like the person who said, Two things make me laugh — a black person painting their nails black, and a blind person putting their head out of the window.","They are exactly like that.","Blind inwardly, they put their heads out of the window of the physical body.","What can they see?","What does their approval or disapproval amount to?","First it is necessary to acquire inner sight.","Then one can see.","But even with sight, how can one see what is hidden?","In this world there are saints who have achieved union, and other saints beyond those, called the Veiled Ones of God.","The former saints are ever pleading humbly, Oh Lord God, show us one of Thy Veiled Ones.","Now as for those tavern-haunting braggarts, of course they cannot reach or see what their own boasting hides.","How can one see the Veiled Ones of God, or know them without their will?","It is not an easy matter.","Even the spiritual angels, who are not tempted by either wealth nor rank, who have no veil to separate them, whose food is the pure Light and Beauty of God, whose eyes — keen and farsighted — see only pure Love, these spiritual angels swing between favor and disfavor toward the people of this world.","This is so that, during our moments of disgrace we might tremble and ask, What have I become?","What do I know?","And if some light should shine upon us and we should be graced by a certain joy, we might give thanks a thousandfold to God, saying, How am I worthy of this?","Submitting yourself in this way, you can experience great joy even from a word or a glimpse of Shams.","For the sail on the ship of our being is our ideal.","When there is a sail, the wind can carry us to mighty places.","When there is no sail, all words are merely wind.","The lover-beloved relationship is very pleasant; everything between the two is sheer informality.","All formalities are for the sake of others.","I would give a great exposition of these words, but the hour is late, and one must labor very hard and dig out rivers to reach the pool of the heart.","In this matter proofs cannot work.","Here one must be a seeker of love, not an observer.","It might seem that I exaggerate the relationship of the lover, but this is not true.","In fact, I see that disciples should give up their own purpose for the sake of their masters form.","Thou whose form is fairer far Than a thousand purposes are.","Every disciple who comes to the master must first abandon his or her own purpose, being in need of the master.","Baha al-Din asked the question: Surely they shouldnt abandon their own purpose for the sake of the masters form, but for the sake of the mas-ters purpose?","Rumi answered: That isnt possible.","If this were so, then both would be masters.","Now you must struggle to find the inward light, to escape and be secure from this fire of confusions.","When you acquire such an inward light, all the desires of this world such as rank, honor, and title pass across your inward heart like a lightning-flash.","With worldlings, the rewards of the unseen world such as the presence of God and yearning for the world of the saints shine upon their hearts for a moment and then pass like a lightningflash.","Therefore it is rank, honor and title they really seek.","However, the people of God become wholly Gods, their faces are turned to God.","They are preoccupied with and absorbed in God.","Worldly passions, like the lust of an impotent man, show briefly but do not take root and quickly pass away.","Rumi said: Sharif Paysukhta has written: God dispenses Its grace, Indifferent to time and space, Itself the Spirit of the Whole Is independent of our soul.","No matter what our ranging thought Within its compass may be brought, We find adoration for the Lord, For It who need not be adored.","These words are shameful; they neither honor God, nor do they honor mankind.","Oh poet, what joy does it give you that God should be supremely independent of you?","This is not the language of friends; this is the language of enemies.","The enemy indeed says, I am indifferent to you and do not care.","Now consider the loyal and ardent lover of God who, when in a state of ecstatic joy, addresses that Beloved, You are independent of me!","They would be like a stoker of the fires at the baths, saying, The Sultan is indifferent and independent of me, a mere stoker.","Indeed, the Sultan is indifferent to all stokers.","What joy would such a miserable stoker feel with the thought that the king was indifferent to them?","No, the right words for the stoker to speak would be: I was on the roof of the baths.","The Sultan passed by.","I hailed him.","He looked well at me and then passed me by, still looking at me.","Such words might well give joy to that stoker.","As for saying, The king is indifferent to stokers, what sort of praise for the king is that, and what joy can it give the stoker?","No matter what our ranging thought Within its compass may be brought, Oh poet, what indeed will pass within the compass of your thought when you find that it is people who are independent of you, they are bored of your thoughts and run away?","Gods independence is certain, oh poet, but if you have a spiritual state worth anything at all.","He will not be independent of you.","Gods closeness to you establishes the degree of your greatness.","Sheikh Mahalla used to say, First see, then converse.","Everyone sees the Sultan, but it is his favorite who enjoys his conversation.","This too is backwards.","Moses enjoyed the speech of God.","With Gods word he was filled.","It was only afterwards he sought to see.","Moses station was the station of speech; the station of Mohammed was the station of seeing.","How then can the Sheikhs statement be correct?","Someone said to Shams-i-Tabriz, I have established the existence of God by a categorical proof.","The following morning our Master, Shams, said, Last night the angels came down and blessed that man, saying, Praise be to God, he has established the existence of our God!","God give him long life!","He has done no harm to the honor of men and women!","Oh poet, God exists.","It needs no proof.","If you do anything at all, establish yourself in some rank and station before Him.","Otherwise, how can you share in His grace?","Nothing exists that does not proclaim His praise.","Lawyers are clever, a hundred per cent competent in their own specialty.","But between them and the spiritual world, a wall has been built to preserve their empire of logic and proofs.","If that wall did not exist as a veil for them, no one would consult them and their work would disappear.","This is like what Shams said, The other world is like a sea, and this world is foam from that sea.","God desired to keep this foam in order.","Therefore, He set certain people with their backs to the sea so this foam would not fall into ruin.","A tent was pitched for a king, and he kept certain people busy constructing this tent.","One says, If I dont make the tent-ropes how will the tent stand up?","Another says, If I dont make the pegs, where will they tie the ropes?","Still, everybody knows these people are servants of the king.","If the weavers gave up weaving and sought to be viziers, the whole world would be naked and bare.","So, they were given a joy for their craft.","They are content with weaving.","Therefore people were created to keep the world of foam in order, and this world was created for the Saint.","God bestows contentment and happiness on everyone in the work that is theirs, so that even if their life should last a hundred thousand years they would still find love for their work.","Every day the love for their craft becomes greater, and subtle skills are bom to them, which bring them infinite joy and pleasure.","Nothing exists that does not proclaim His praise.","There is one praise for the rope-maker, another for the carpenter who makes the tent-poles, another for the maker of the tent-pins, another for the weaver who weaves the cloth for the tent, another for the saints for whom the tent is made.","Now these seekers who come to us, wanting some time with us, if we say nothing they are disgusted and hurt.","Yet if we say something it must be beneficial to their level of attainment.","So we approach cautiously, and they leave, criticizing us, saying, They are holding back what they know.","They are hiding from us and running away.","How should the fire run away from the cook pot?","It cannot.","The truth is that when we see that the vessel is weak, we draw back some distance to protect it.","So, it is really the pot that runs away.","Our mnning away is their mnning away.","We are a mirror.","If they move to run away, it appears to them in us.","We run away for their sake.","In a mirror people see themselves.","If they see us as weary, that weariness is theirs and a reflection of their weakness.","There is no room here for weariness; what use do we have for weariness?","In the baths, once, I showed great submission to Sheikh Salah al-Din, and Sheikh Salah al-Din showed great submission to me.","Confronted by his submission, I protested.","I thought to myself, You are carrying submission too far.","Submission is better by degrees: First you kiss the hand, then the foot.","Little by little you come to a point where it does not stand out as a display, and in return they are moved by your sincerity.","They are not chased away, or forced into matching courtesy with courtesy, when you gradually show your affection.","We must act this same way with friends and enemies, doing things gradually.","For instance, with an enemy, first we offer them our advice, little by little.","If they do not listen, we show some force.","If they do not heed that, then we drive them away.","The work of the world proceeds in this way.","Dont you see the peace and friendliness of spring?","In the beginning it shows us warmth little by little, then it displays its graces more and more.","Look at the trees, how little by little they advance.","First a smile, then they show their trappings of leaves and fruit, like dervishes and Sufis offering their hearts, giving away all that they possess.","Men and women run away from every goal, whether worldly or spiritual, because they overestimate the initial task.","The proper way is a bit at a time.","It is the same if someone eats too much; they should diminish it daily by a small bit, gradually.","In that way, before a year or two have passed, they will have cut down what they eat by half, reducing it in such a way that their body does not notice.","So it is with worship, withdrawing into solitude, attending to the service of God, and prayer.","When a person enters upon the Way of God, for a while their prayers will be short.","But after that, if they pray with their whole heart, their prayers will go on and on without end.","Rumi said to Ibn Chavish: The root of the matter is that you should guard against this backbiting when talking about Sheikh Salah al-Din.","Perhaps this will remove these dark shadows and clouds that surround you.","How can you defend yourself?","People have left their own country, their fathers and mothers, their households, kinsfolk and families, and have journeyed from Hind to Sind until their boots were cut to shreds, in search of someone having the fragrance of the other world.","How many men and women have died of sorrow, never succeeding nor encountering such a person!","As for you, you know such a man here in your own house, and you turn your back on him.","This is a tragedy of recklessness.","You used to tell me that Sheikh Salah al-Din was the sheikh of sheikhs, a great and mighty man.","From the day I entered his service, you said to me, I never heard him once mention your name except as Rumi, Our Master, Our Lord, Our Creator.","I never heard him change this humble expression for a single day.","It must be your ambitions that have blinded you now.","Today you say that Salah al-Din is nothing.","What wrong has Sheikh Salah al-Din ever done you?","Only, when seeing you fall into a pit of self-destruction, he said to you, Beware of the pit.","He said this out of compassion for you, above all others, but you reject that compassion.","Now, you find yourself in the midst of his wrath, and having plunged into this wrath, how will you escape?","That is why he says, Do not dwell in my house of wrath and anger.","Move into my house of grace and compassion.","Do something in praise of me, and enter my house of love.","He says this because then your heart will shed this darkness and fill with light.","He says this to you for your own sake, for your own good, but you charge his compassion to some ulterior motive.","What ulterior motive should a man like that have towards you?","Isnt it true that whenever you are filled to satisfaction with drink or music, at the same time you are pleased with every enemy, forgiving them all?","In that hour, unbeliever and believer become the same in your eyes.","Now Sheikh Salah al-Din is the very ocean of this spiritual joy.","All the seas of satisfaction are within him.","How could he hate anyone, or have plans against them?","And especially, what designs would he have against such as locusts and frogs?","How can he, who possesses such empire and grandeur, be compared with such miserable creatures?","Is it not said that the Water of Life must be found in darkness?","This darkness surrounds the saints, in whose being we find that Eternal Spring.","The Water of Life is hidden in their darkness.","If you turn from darkness and run away from it, how can the Water of Life ever reach you?","Dont you think if you wanted to learn sodomy from sodomites, or harlotry from harlots, you could never learn anything without putting up with a thousand disagreeable things, beatings and the thwarting of your desires?","This is the only way you could attain your goal.","Then how do you expect to attain the eternal and everlasting source of life, which is the station of the prophets and saints, without anything disagreeable or without any sacrifice?","How could this ever happen?","What the Sheikh prescribes for you is the same as what Sheikhs of old prescribed; that you give up your wealth and position.","Indeed, they used to tell a disciple, Leave your wife, that we may take her, and the disciples put up with that.","As for you, when he counsels you a simple thing, how is it that you run away?","Do you not see how people are overcome by blindness and ignorance when they fall in love, how they will fawn and grovel and sacrifice all their wealth, seeking somehow to win the one they want with every effort.","Night and day they think of nothing else, never wearying of their pursuit, yet wearying of everything else.","Then, is the love for the Sheikh and the love for God less than this?","Yet, at the smallest word of advice and discipline you object and desert the Sheikh.","Hence it is known that you are no lover or seeker.","Were you a true lover and seeker, you would put up with many times what we have described.","To your heart, dung would become honey and sugar.","Rumi said: I would like to go to Tuqat, for that region is warm.","Although Antalya is warm, only a few people there understand our language.","However, I was speaking there one day when a party of unbelievers was present.","In the middle of my talk they began to weep with emotion and show signs of ecstasy.","Someone asked: What can they understand?","What do they know?","Only one Muslim in a thousand understands this kind of talk.","What could an unbeliever understand that would cause them to weep?","Rumi answered: It isnt necessary for them to understand the inner meaning of what we say.","The vessel of this meaning is the words themselves, and this they do recognize.","After all, everyone knows of the Oneness of God, Creator and Provider, the source of all life, where all things return.","When anyone hears these words, which are a description and expression of God, a universal emotion and inner feeling stirs them, since out of these words comes a scent of their Beloved and their Quest.","The ways may vary, but the goal is one.","Dont you see that there are many roads to the Kaaba?","For some the road is from Rum, for some from Syria, others come from Persia or China or by sea from India and Yemen.","So if you consider the roads, they are beyond counting, with infinite differences.","But when you consider the goal they are all in accord with one desire.","The hearts of all are upon the Kaaba.","The hearts are one in their longing and love for the Kaaba, and in that there is no room for separation.","That love is neither belief nor non-belief, for it has nothing to do with the various roads.","Once we arrive, this argument and war and those differences in the roads — this woman saying to that man, You are false, you are an infidel, and that man saying the same about her — once we arrive at the Kaaba, we realize that such fighting is over the roads only, and that the goal of all is the same.","For instance, a bowls spirit is in love with its maker, and is a slave to those hands that fashion it.","Yet some see this bowl and say it should be placed just as it is on the table.","Some say the inside of it should be washed first, some say the outside of it must be cleaned.","Some say all of it, some say it must never be washed at all.","The diversity of opinion comes from the bowls many uses, but as to the fact that the bowl certainly had a creator who fashioned it, and that it did not come into existence of itself, on this all agree.","Now, men and women in their inmost hearts love God, seek Him, pray to Him and in all things put their hope in Him, recognizing none but God as the central reality ordering their affairs.","This is neither belief nor non-belief.","Within the heart it has no name.","But when the water of innate truth flows out of the heart towards the sluice of the tongue and takes form, it acquires shape and expression.","There it is given the name of infidelity or faith, good or evil.","It is the same with plants growing out of the earth.","At first they have no form at all.","When they make their appearance in this world their shoots all look fine, delicate and white.","But as they grow further they take on different shapes and colors.","Then we can call them by name.","When believers and infidels sit together and say nothing, they are one and the same.","There is no conflict of belief; the heart is a free world.","Beliefs are subtle things and cannot be judged.","People can judge by outward expression only, God is the fashioner of our secret hearts.","When God uncovers your own beliefs to you, not a hundred thousand efforts can hide them again.","As for the saying that God needs no instrument, do you not see how He reveals those ideas and beliefs in you without any instruments, without any pen, without any pigment?","Those beliefs are like birds of the air, and wild deer.","Until you catch them, it is not allowable by law to sell them.","It is not in your power to sell a bird on the wing, for how can you deliver it?","Since it is not in your power, it is not yours to sell.","Beliefs then, so long as they are in the heart, are without name and token — they cannot be judged.","Would any judge say, In your heart you made this oath, you had this idea, or Come, swear that in your heart you did not think this?","No judge would say this, because no one can judge the heart.","Beliefs are birds of the air.","Yet once they have been expressed, then immediately they can be judged as true or false, good or evil.","There is a world of bodies, a world of ideas, a world of fantasies, a world of possibilities.","God is beyond all worlds, neither within them, nor without.","Consider then how God fashions our beliefs, forming them without material means, without pen or instrument.","As for this fancy or that idea, if you were to tear open the breast and search particle by particle you would never find that thought.","Not in the blood, not in the vein, not above, not below.","Being immaterial and beyond time and space, you would not find it outside the breast, either.","Since Gods mark is so subtle as to be without trace, consider how subtle and without trace is God, Itself, the fashioner of all!","Just as the physical body is gross in relation to the inner meaning of a person, so this subtle and invisible meaning is a gross body and form next to Gods subtlety.","All Muslims say, We will enter the Holy Mosque.","Some Muslims say, If God wills, we will enter.","Those who use the expression if God wills are the true lovers of God.","For the lover does not think that theyre in charge of things and a free agent.","They recognize that the Beloved is in charge.","Hence they say, If this Beloved wills, I will enter.","Now the literalists take the Holy Mosque to be the Kaaba in Mecca.","However, lovers and the elect of God take the Holy Mosque to mean union with God.","So they say, If God wills, we will attain Him and be honored by the sight of Him.","For God to say, If God wills, is very rare.","It is the tale of a stranger, and only a stranger can understand such a tale.","Yet God has certain servants who are so well loved that He seeks them out, showering them with blessings, and carrying out all the actions of a lover.","Just as the lover would say, If God wills, I will enter, so God says on behalf of that saint, If God wills.","If I were to try explaining this subtlety, even the saints who have attained God would lose the thread of the discourse.","How then is it possible to speak of such mysteries and mystic states to mortal men and women?","The pen wrote this far, and then it broke!","If someone cant see the camel on top of their own house, how can they see the thread of one hair in the mouth of that camel?","To resume: Those lovers who say, If God wills, such people are absorbed in God.","There is no room for anything else.","Otherness does not even exist.","For until a person has surrendered their image of a separate existence, the Holy Mosque cannot be found.","There is none dwelling in the house but God.","The vision He entrusted to His Messenger...","This vision is the dream of lovers and true people of God, but the true meaning is only revealed in the other world.","When you see in a dream that you are riding on a horse, this means you will attain your goal; yet what connection does the horse have with a goal?","If you dream that you have been given coins of good currency, the meaning is that you will hear true and good words from a wise person; but how does a coin resemble a word?","If you dream that you have been hanged before a crowd, you will become the chief of a people; but how do gallows resemble leadership?","In the same way, the affairs of this world are a dream.","This world is the dream of a sleeper, and its meaning is seen quite differently in the other world.","There it is truly judged by the Divine Interpreter, for to Him all things are revealed.","Like a gardener who enters an orchard and looks at the trees, without even looking at the fruit on the branches, they can judge this tree to be a date, that one a fig, that a pomegranate, a pear, or an apple.","The true people of God know the science of trees, therefore they need not wait for the resurrection to see the interpretation of life.","Such a person sees beforehand what will be, just as the gardener knows what fruit each branch will surely yield.","All things in this world — wealth, a mate, and clothing — are desired for something other than themselves.","Dont you see that even with a hundred thousand gold coins, if you were hungry, and you could find no food, you could not feed yourself on gold?","A mate is for the sake of children, companionship and to satisfy passion.","Clothes are to ward off the cold.","In this way, all things are desired for some other thing, each desire leading to the next, all ending in the desire for God.","He is desired for His own sake, not for anything else.","Being beyond all, greater than all, nobler and subtler than all, can God be desired for something less?","So, He is the goal.","Within God is the completion of all things, beyond Him there is no transcending.","The human mind chums with doubts and difficulties.","The mind can never be rid of these except when it is truly in love — then all its doubts and difficulties vanish.","Your love renders you blind and deaf.","For example, when Iblis would not bow down before Adam and opposed Gods command, iblis said, My essence is spirit, his essence is clay.","Why should the higher bow down before the lower?","So God banished Iblis for opposing and contending with Divine Law.","Then Iblis argued, Alas, O Lord!","You made all things.","This was Your temptation, and now You are cursing me and banishing me.","Yet when Adam sinned, God expelled him from Paradise, but Adam said nothing back.","Then God said to Adam, O Adam, I have held you responsible and punished you for the sin you committed, why did you not argue with Me?","After all, you had a perfect case.","You could have said, All things proceed from You and are made by You.","Whatever You desire in the world comes to pass, and whatever You desire not will never come to pass.","You had a clear and valid case, why did you not argue it?","Adam answered, I knew that well, Lord, but I did not forget courtesy in Your presence.","Because of my love for You I could say nothing.","Thus Adams love stayed firm and was not swayed.","This sacred Law of Love is a watering-place, a fountainhead.","It is just like the court of a king where many study the kings laws, his commandments and prohibitions, his government — equal justice for nobles and commons — etc.","The edicts of the king are without end, and on them the stability of the country rests.","But the status of dervishes and Sufis is one of love for the king.","Out of their love springs conversation with the king, and knowing his mind and heart.","What is knowledge of the kings laws, compared with knowing the ruler himself, his mind and heart?","There is a vast difference.","The Sufis and their various teachings are like a school with many scholars.","The headmaster pays each scholar according to their qualifications, giving to one ten, the next twenty, another thirty.","We too dispense our words according to everyones degree and qualification.","Speaking to each according to the degree of their understanding.","People build these sacred monuments for a particular reason: either to display their generosity for the sake of fame, or to gain a reward in heaven.","God should be the true object in honoring the saints, their tombs and graves.","The saints do not need to be honored; they are an honor to themselves.","If a lamp desires to be placed up high, it wants this for the sake of others, not for its own sake.","What does a lamp care whether it is high or low?","It is still a lamp shedding light.","But a lamp wants its light to reach others.","The sun, if it were not in the height of the heavens would still be the same sun, only the world would fall into darkness.","So the sun attains its height not for its own sake, but for the love of others.","The saints, too, have gone beyond such things as above and below, and the worship of people.","Look at yourself when you are granted a fragment of ecstasy and a flash of grace from the other world.","In that moment you see no above or below, mastership or discipleship, or even yourself, which is nearer to you than all else.","These things do not enter your mind.","So how can the saints, who are the windows and doorways for that light and inspiration, be concerned about above and below.","Their heart is with God, and God is independent of below and above.","This higher and lower belongs to us who have heads and feet.","Mohammed said, Do not hold me above Jonah, son of Matthew, just because his ascension was in the belly of a whale while my ascension was in heaven upon the Throne.","He meant, God is neither above nor below.","His presence is the same, whether in heaven or in the belly of the whale.","There are many who have aims of their own, while God has another goal.","God desired the religion of Mohammed to be honored, to be spread abroad and to abide down through time.","Consider how many volumes have been written about the Koran.","Yet the aim of those writers was to display their own virtuosity.","Zamakhshari filled his Kashshaf with numerous details of grammar, lexicography and rhetoric to display his own learning — but it also fulfilled Gods purpose, namely the exaltation of the religion of Mohammed.","So, all people do Gods work, whether they know it or not.","A man and woman satisfy their lust with each other for the sake of their own enjoyment, but the result is the birth of a child.","In the same way everyone works for his or her own pleasure and enjoyment, and this is the means of maintaining the order of the world.","In reality they are serving God, although that is not their intent.","In the same way, people carve miniature mosques at great expense to beautify their doors and walls.","Mecca is the true aim and object of honor, and its honoring is all the greater since that was not their true intention.","The greatness of the saints means nothing in this world.","By God, yes, they have an elevation and greatness, but it is beyond space and time.","Suppose, for instance, you placed a silver dirham on the roof, and a gold piece under it.","Is not the gold still superior in all circumstances?","Similarly, the chaff is above the sieve and the com falls under it; but how can the chaff be above the com?","The superiority of the com does not come from its position in this world, but from its place in that world of realities.","Someone entered, and Rumi said: He is beloved and humble, like a branch loaded with fruit — the fruit weighs it down.","A branch with no fruit raises its head up high, like the white poplar, but when that fruit exceeds all bounds, they put props under the branch so it will not come down altogether.","Mohammed was extremely humble.","All the fruits of this world and the next were gathered upon his branch, so of course he was humbler than others.","He said, No one ever preceded the Messenger of God in making a greeting.","No one was able to precede the Prophet in offering greetings because he outstripped all others in extreme humility, and always made his greetings first.","Even if others had said their greeting first, still his humility came before they could speak, for everyone has learned the humble greeting from him and hear his greeting within themselves before they say a word.","Everything that ancient people or modem people possess is a shadow of the Messenger of God.","Though a persons shadow might cross the threshold before them, still they are first.","True, their shadow may appear to lead, but this shadow comes from them, and therefore always follows.","Our grace and humility are not made from this present moment; these atoms existed in that primeval time, from those particles and parts of the first Messenger of God.","In this hour they become visible again, but this splendor and brightness is ancient.","Its original light was altogether purer and brighter and more humble.","Some people see the beginnings of things, and some look to the end.","Those who look to the goal are great and mighty, for although their eyes are fixed on this moment; still they look into the world beyond.","But those who see the beginning are greater.","They say, Why look to the end?","If wheat is sown in the beginning, barley will not grow.","If oats are planted, you cannot reap corn.","So their gaze is fixed upon the beginning.","Still there are others even greater yet, who look at neither the beginnings nor the endings — the start and finish do not enter their minds...","they are absorbed in God.","However, those who are absorbed in worldly things do not see the beginning or end either, but in their case this is out of extreme carelessness — they are the fodder of fools.","So the Man and Woman of God are the foundation.","But for you, I would not have created the heavens."," All that exists — honor and humility, authority and high degree — all are our inheritance from Them.","All attributes are Their shadow, for everything has manifested from Them.","Whatever this hand does it does as the shadow of Spirit, for Spirits shadow directs it.","In truth, Spirit has no shadow, yet it has a shadow without a shadow, just as meaning has form without form.","If the shadow of Spirit were not over us, all of our body would wither away — our hands would no longer grasp, our feet would not know how to walk, our eyes and ears would be lost in confusion.","Therefore, in reality all those actions proceed from Spirit — the body is the instrument of Spirits tongue.","In the same way, there is a great person, the caliph of their time.","They are like the Universal Spirit, and the spirits of humankind are their body.","Whatever the people of this world do is in their shadow.","If the actions of some are in error, it is because the Universal Spirit has lifted its shadow from their heads.","When someone goes mad and acts crazy, everyone knows that reason has left them, and no longer casts its shadow over them.","They are far away from the shadow and shelter of Spirit.","Spirit is kin to the angel.","Although angels have definite form, while Spirit does not, both possess the same nature and act exactly the same.","We should not be fooled by the form when they are identical in every way.","If you dissolved an angels form, nothing would remain but Spirit.","Therefore angels are the embodiment of Spirit.","A bird can be molded of wax, complete with feathers and wings, but still it is wax.","If you melt it, dont you see that its head and feet, feathers and wings all return to wax?","Nothing else remains.","From this we know that it is wax embodied into a certain shape, but wax none the less.","Similarly, ice is nothing but water.","When you melt it, only its form dissolves.","The human being was created like this: They took the feathers of an angel, and tied them to the tail of an ass, in hopes that the ass — from the radiance and companionship of the angel — might become an angel, too.","So what is so wonderful if this ass became a human?","God is able to do all things.","When a child is first bom, it is worse than an ass, sticking its hands in filth and then into its mouth to lick.","The mother must spank the baby to stop it.","The ass at least has some sort of discrimination; when it urinates, it opens its legs so the urine will not trickle on them.","Yet the child, who is worse than an ass, God raises into a man or woman.","If God should turn the ass into a human, what is so astounding in that?","With God, nothing is a cause for astonishment.","At the resurrection, all parts of a person will speak.","The philosophers interpret this allegorically.","They say: When the hand speaks, perhaps some sign, like a scratch or abscess, will show on its skin.","Then you can say, in a sense that the hand speaks since it gives information, I ate something causing inflammation, and so I became like this.","Or the hand is wounded and becomes black.","These signs tell a story, saying A knife struck me, or I rubbed myself against a black pot.","So much for the philosophers!","The Sunni theologians say: God forbid!","No indeed!","The hands and feet will speak just as the tongue speaks.","On the day of resurrection a person will deny their past saying, I did not steal.","But their hand will answer, Yes you stole, since I took it.","They will then turn to their hand, saying, You have never spoken before, how can you speak now?","The hand will answer, God gave us speech, just as It gives all things speech.","It gives speech to the door and wall, the stone and clod.","What is so astonishing about that?","You speak with your tongue, yet it is merely a piece of flesh.","Your hand is also a piece of flesh.","Is your tongue endowed with reason?","Yet when God commanded it to speak, it spoke.","Words come according to the attainment of the listener.","Speech is like water that flows from a reservoir.","How can the water know where they will send it — into the cucumber-patch, the onion-bed, or the rose-garden?","But I know this: when water comes in forrents, there the lands are thirsty and extensive.","But if only a little trickle flows, that land is small — a little orchard, or a tiny courtyard.","The Prophet said, God inspires wisdom in the tongue of the teacher according to the aspirations of the student.","I am a cobbler: the leather is plentiful, but I cut and stitch according to the size of the foot.","I am your mirror, I am your measure; As much as your stature is, So much my treasure.","A worm lives under the earth in darkness.","It has no eyes or ears because where it lives it does not need them.","Since there is no need, why give eyes and ears to worms?","God has no scarcity of eyes and ears and It is not miserly, but It gives according to the need.","Anything else becomes a urden.","Gods wisdom and grace remove burdens; how could It do otherwise?","For instance, if you gave tailors the tools of a carpenter — axe, saw, and a file — you would burden them, since they cannot use such instalments to make clothes.","So God gives according to need and no more.","Just as those worms thrive in darkness under the earth, so there are people who are content and satisfied to live in the darkness of this world, having no need for the heavenly world, and no yearning for the Vision.","Of what use to them is the eye of clairvoyance or the ear of understanding?","Their work in this world needs only the eyes they have.","Since they have no desire for the other side, why give them clairvoyance, which would be useless to them?","Do not think that saints No longer travel upon this road.","Perfect in all life s ways.","Traceless lovers of God.","It is because you cannot see Their secrets through your eyes, You fancy in your vain conceit, No others can gain that prize.","This world continues through heedlessness.","If it were not for heedlessness this world would not remain.","Yearning for God, contemplation of the next world, intoxication, and ecstasy — these are the builders of that inner realm.","If these true desires revealed themselves to all people, there would be a worldwide exodus.","None would remain.","Yet God wants both worlds to exist, so It has appointed two sheriffs one heedlessness, the other heedfulness — so that both houses can thrive.","Rumi said: If I appear lacking in gratitude and appreciation for the kindness and support you show me, both directly and indirectly, it is not out of arrogance or indifference, nor is it because I dont know the importance of returning your favor and love.","But I am aware from the purity of your efforts that you do these things sincerely for the sake of God, so I leave it to God to thank you.","If I concerned myself with thanking you, granting you verbal honor and praising you, it would be as if some part of the treasure that God has set aside for you was already given, some part of your reward had already been paid.","Humble attitudes, offering thanks and applause — these are worldly pleasures.","But when you have gone to worldly pains such as the sacrifice of wealth and position, how can worldly pleasure be a satisfactory return?","Therefore, I do not offer thanks since that reward should come entirely from God.","No one can eat wealth.","Wealth is sought for what it brings, not what it is.","With wealth people purchase horses, servant-girls and slaves.","Then they display these riches so that others will praise and applaud them.","Therefore, it is the world itself that is held up so high, and it is this world that is praised and applauded.","Sheik Nassaj of Bukhara was an honored, spiritual man.","Learned and great people came to visit him and knelt at his feet.","The Sheik was unlettered, but they loved to hear him expounding on the Koran and Traditions of the Prophet.","He would say, I do not know Arabic.","Translate a verse from the Koran so I can tell you its meaning.","They would translate the verse.","Then he would begin to explain and reveal the truth in it.","He would say, The Prophet was in such and such a situation when he uttered this verse.","The circumstances took place like this...","And he would describe in detail the spiritual level of that situation, the ways leading up to it, and how the Prophet gained that state.","One day a descendant of Ali was praising a certain judge while standing next to the judge, saying, There is no judge like this man anywhere in the world.","He does not take bribes.","He dispenses justice amongst others without partiality or favor, purely and sincerely for the sake of God.","When Sheik Nassaj heard this he replied, To say that he doesnt take bribes is certainly a lie.","You, an honored descendant of Ali, praise and applaud him to his face, saying that he does not take bribes.","Isnt that a bribe?","What could be a better bribe than that?","Sheik Tirmidhi once said, Saiyid Burhan al-Din expounds truths so well because he has studied the books, secret writings and treatises of the masters.","A Sufi answered, But you study them as well.","Why dont you speak like he does?","Tirmidhi replied, Well, Burhan al-Din has also made great spiritual efforts and accomplishments.","The Sufi said, Why didnt you say that in the first place?","You only know how to repeat what you have read; that is the difference.","But we are now speaking of something greater than books — you too can speak of that!","Few care about the other world at all.","They have fixed their hearts upon this world entirely.","Some seek these teachings to eat the bread of God, some only to inspect the bread.","They want to learn these words just to sell them.","These words are like a beautiful bride; if a beautiful maiden is bought to be sold again, how can she love her buyer or fix her heart upon him?","Since the pleasure of that merchant comes only in selling, he is as good as impotent.","He buys the girl to sell her, not having the manhood and virility to want her for himself.","If a fine Indian sword falls into the hands of an effeminate man, he will take it to sell it.","If a mighty Pehlevi bow falls into his hands, he will also sell it since he does not have the strength of arm to draw the bow.","He desires that bow for the value of the string, he has no capacity for the string, itself.","He is in love merely with what it will bring.","When such a man sells the bow, he trades it for rouge and indigo.","What else should he do?","Marvelous!","What could he buy better than that?","These words mean nothing except to the initiated!","Beware!","Do not say, I have understood.","The more you understand and grasp these words, the farther you will be from understanding them.","Their meaning comes in not understanding.","All your troubles, misfortunes and disappointments arise from such understanding.","This understanding is a chain for you.","You must escape it to gain anything at all.","You say, I filled my sheep-skin in the sea, but the sea was too great to be contained in my sheepskin.","That is absurd.","If you say, My sheep-skin was lost in the sea, that is excellent!","That is the root of the matter.","Reason is fine and useful until it brings you to the door of the King.","Once you have reached His door, give up reason, for in that hour reason is a sheer loss to you, a highway robber.","When you have reached the King, surrender yourself to Him, you have no use then for the how and wherefore.","For instance, you have an uncut cloth you want made into a tunic or a cloak.","Reason brings you to a tailor.","Until that moment reason is fine, for it brings the cloth to the tailor.","Now in that very moment reason must be forgotten and you must abandon yourself wholly to the direction of the tailor.","In the same way, reason is fine when you are sick because it brings you to the physician.","After that, reason is of no use to you, since you must surrender yourself to the advice of the physician.","Your companions hear your secret cries of love for God.","When they come to you, you will know which of them has that true substance — the responsiveness of Soul.","In a train of camels, the camel in rut is easily spotted by its eyes, its manner of walking and its breath.","Their mark is on their faces, the trace of prostration.","Although it is the roots of a tree that drink, you can see the results of that drinking through its branches, leaves and fruit.","The tree that does not drink withers — how can this stay concealed?","You will hear their loud shouts because they understand paragraphs from a single word you speak, and from a single letter they recognize all the overtones.","They are like someone who has studied the Koran; As soon as they hear the first word from a Koran commentary, they understand all the root ideas and questions, since they know its source.","They will offer observations on that single word as if to say, Within the depths of this subject I know many things and see many things, for I have worked and studied, turning night into day, and I have found the treasures.","Did We not expand your breast out of love for you?","The expansion of the breast is infinite.","Once that expansive truth has been tasted, we understand much from even one hint.","But beginners will only understand, from a word, the meaning of that one word.","What inner knowledge and ecstasy can they possess?","Words are spoken according to the capacity of the listeners.","If beginners do not know how to draw wisdom out, how can it come forth?","Once they breathe in, then wisdom will fill their hearts.","But they say, For heavens sake, why arent the words spoken?","The answer is, For heavens sake, why dont you draw this wisdom in?","Whoever withholds the power to listen also withholds from the speaker the impulse to speak.","In the time of the Prophet, a certain unbeliever had a Muslim slave who was a man of true substance.","One morning the unbeliever ordered his slave, Fetch basins.","I am going to the baths.","On the way they passed by the Prophet praying in the mosque with his companions.","The slave said, Master, for Gods good sake take this bowl for a moment, so that I can make a few genuflections, then I will attend to you.","Entering the mosque, he prayed.","The Prophet came out with his companions.","The slave remained alone in the mosque.","His master waited for him till mid-morning, then he shouted, Come out, slave!","The slave answered, They wont let me go, as the work has gone beyond bounds.","The master put his head inside the mosque to see who it was that would not let the slave go.","Except for a shoe and a shadow he saw no one.","Nobody stirred.","He said, Well, who is it that wont let you come out?","The slave replied, The same One who will not allow you to come in, the very same One whom you cannot see.","People always want to see new things that they have not yet seen.","Night and day they seek after new experiences.","They are slaves of anything they have not yet enjoyed, but become bored and run away from what they have already heard and understood.","For this reason the philosophers reject the Vision of God, saying, If you can become bored with what you see, this cannot be truth.","The Sunni theologians say, This could occur only if God was single-colored.","But in truth He comes forth in a hundred colors, every instant.","Every day He is upon a task.","If God should reveal Itself a hundred thousand times, not one moment would resemble another.","Every instant you see Gods display and yet not even one act resembles another.","In times of happiness you see one display, in times of weeping you find another.","During moments of fear you see one face, during hope another.","Since Gods creations and His acts vary infinitely, not one like another, so you can be sure the display of His Essence also varies endlessly.","You, too, being a single spark of Gods flame, change a thousand times every instant and never stay the same.","There are certain seekers of God who proceed from the Koran to God.","Others more elect come from God, find the Koran here, and know that God has sent it down.","We have seen the Remembrance, and We will watch over it."," Commentators say that this quote refers to the Koran, but it also means, We have seen in you a substance, a seeking, a yearning.","We will watch over that, not letting it go to waste, but will bring it to its rightful place.","Once you say God, then stand firm under all calamities that rain down upon you.","A certain person came to the Prophet and said to him, Truly I love you.","The Prophet said, Take heed what you say.","The person repeated, Truly I love you.","Mohammed said, Take heed what you say.","They said, Truly I love you.","Mohammed said, Now stand firm, for with my own hand I will slay you.","Woe upon you!","Another person came to the Prophet and said, I dont want this religion.","By God, take it back.","Ever since I entered your religion Ive had no peace for a single day.","My wealth is gone, my spouse has left, my child cannot be found, my respect is destroyed, my strength is sapped, even my lust has disappeared.","Mohammed answered, What did you expect?","Wherever our religion goes it does not return without uprooting that person and sweeping clean their house.","None but the purified shall touch God.","So long as there remains in you a single trace of self-love, God will not show His face to you.","You will not be worthy of His presence.","You must become wholly indifferent to yourself and the world, so that Friend can show His face.","So, whenever our religion lodges in a heart, it will not withdraw its hand until it brings that heart to God and severs from it all that is untrue.","The Prophet went on to say to that person, You have no peace because sorrows purpose is to empty you of previous joys.","So long as food fills your stomach, you are not given new food to eat.","During elimination, we eat nothing.","When we are empty and hungry, then we are given food.","Be patient and grieve, for grieving is the emptying of yourself.","After you are empty, then joy can enter — a joy with no sorrow, a rose without a thorn, a wine without crop-sickness.","Why, night and day, do you search for quiet and rest?","They cannot be found in this world.","But not for one instant do you give up seeking these things.","The comfort you find in this world is like a lightning flash that passes but never endures.","And what kind of lightning is it?","Lightning full of hail, full of rain and snow, full of suffering.","For instance, someone sets out for Antalya.","They go toward Caesarea hoping to reach Antalya, and never turn back even though it is impossible to reach Antalya by this route.","But another who goes by the Antalyan road, though lame and feeble, still they will reach their goal, since that is where the Antalyan road ends.","No task in this world or the next is without suffering.","Therefore, devote your suffering to the next world so it will not be wasted.","You say, O Mohammed take away this religion from me, for I can find no rest.","How can our religion let anyone go before it brings them to the goal?","There was a certain teacher who, due to poverty, wore only a single garment of cotton in the middle of winter.","By chance, forrents of rain brought down a bear out of the mountains, carrying the bear along with its head hidden in the water.","The children, seeing its back, cried, Teacher, look!","A fur coat has fallen into the water, and you are cold.","Take it!","The teacher in dire need and coldness jumped in to catch the fur coat.","The bear quickly plunged its claws into the teachers back.","The bear in the water thus caught the teacher.","Teacher, the children shouted, either grab the fur coat or let it go and come out!","I am letting the fur coat go, answered the teacher, but the fur coat isnt letting me go.","What should I do?","How can Gods love let you go?","We should be thankful that God does not let us go.","When a child is small it knows nothing but milk and its mother.","Yet, God does not leave the child there, but leads it on to eat bread and to play, and in this manner draws it on to the stage of reason.","So too in this world — which is in its infancy compared with that other world — God does not leave you here, but brings you on so you can realize that this is infancy and nothing at all.","I am amazed at the people who must be dragged to Paradise in chains and fetters.","Take them and fetter them, then roast them in Paradise, then roast them in Union, then roast them in Beauty, then roast them in Perfection."," Fishermen do not drag out a fish all at once.","Once the hook has entered the fishs throat they reel it in a little so it will lose strength.","Then they let it out, and draw it in again, until it weakens.","When the hook of Love falls into our throat, God draws us gradually so those bad attributes will leave us little by little.","There is no God, but God — that is what the common folk say.","The elect believe There is no Self, but Self.","Someone sees in a dream that they are a ruler.","They are seated on a throne with servants, chamberlains and princes standing by.","They say, I am ruler, and there is no ruler but I.","They say this in their sleep.","When they wake up and see no one in the house but themself, they say, I am, and there is no other than that I Am.","To realize this, one must be fully awake.","Every religion denies every other.","One group says, We are the true ones, revelation belongs to us, all others are false.","All the others say exactly the same.","So the two and seventy creeds are in agreement that all others are without revelation.","They are all in accord that there is no revelation to any other religion, and that out of the lot of them there is but one true path.","So, a believer must have discrimination and wisdom to know which one it is.","Such discrimination and wisdom is true faith.","Someone said: The religions that dont know are many, and those that know are few.","If we are to occupy ourselves with distinguishing all of them it will be a long business.","Rumi answered: Although there are many who do not know, when you know a few you have known them all.","In the same way when you know a single handful of com, you know all the com-stacks in the world.","If you have tasted sugar once, though halvah is made in a hundred different varieties, still in that halvah you know the sugar.","If these words seem repetitious to you, it is only because you have not yet learned the first lesson, so I must say it every day.","There was once a student who was taught for three months, but never went beyond A is for apple.","The childs father came and said to the teacher, I never fail to pay your fees.","If I have ever failed a payment, please let me know, and I will pay more.","The teacher answered, The failure is not yours, but the child doesnt go beyond this point.","The teacher called the student and said, Say, A is for apple.","The child said, Is for apple, unable to say A.","The teacher said, You see?","Since the child has not passed the first point, how can I give any more?","The father said, Praise belongs to God.","We do not say, Praise belongs to God after a meal because there was a shortage of bread.","Bread and blessings are without limit, but the appetite is gone and the guests are sated.","That is why we say, Praise belongs to God.","The bread of revelation is very different from this worldly bread, because even with no appetite you can force yourself to eat as much worldly bread as you want.","And since it is inanimate, you can drag it wherever you like.","It does not have the spirit to withhold itself from those who are not worthy.","But Divine bread is a living wisdom and a living blessing.","As long as you desire nothing else, it comes towards you and becomes your food.","But should your desire fail, you will not be able to eat it, even by force.","It hides behind the veil and will not show you its face.","(Rumi was telling about the miracles of the saints.","He said:) For someone to fly from here to the Kaaba in an instant is not so wonderful, even though there are such stories of saints having done so.","But a true miracle is this: that God should bring you from a lowly estate to a high estate, that you should travel from ignorance to reason, from the inanimate to life.","Just as at first you were earth and mineral, God brought you to the vegetable world.","Then you journeyed from the vegetable world to the animal world, from the animal world to the world of humanity.","These are the true miracles.","Through these stations and forms you journeyed, never once thinking or imagining where you would arrive, by which road you would be taken, or how you would be brought.","Even so, you will be brought on to a hundred other worlds.","Do not doubt it, and if you are told such stories, believe them.","A bowl of poison was brought as a present to Umar.","Of what use is this?","he asked.","They said, When it is not publicly advisable to kill someone openly, you can give them a little of this.","Then they will die secretly.","If it is an enemy who cannot be slain with the sword, with a little of this they can be killed clandestinely.","Y ou have brought me a very good thing, he said.","Give it to me to drink, for within me is a mighty enemy whom the sword cannot reach.","I have no greater enemy in the world than he.","There is no need to drink it all up in one gulp, they told him.","Just one sip is enough.","This bowl is sufficient for a hundred thousand people.","My enemy, too, is not one person, said Umar.","He is a thousand strong, and has overthrown a hundred thousand.","He then seized the cup and drank it all in one draught.","At once the assembled multitude all became believers, crying, Your religion is true!","You have all become believers, said Umar, and yet this infidel within me has not yet become a believer.","What Umar desired was not the faith of the common people.","He had that faith and more — indeed, he had the faith of the veracious.","He was seeking the faith of the Prophets in absolute certainty.","That was what he hoped for.","The report of a lion spread abroad through all parts of the world.","It was said this lion had a special quality: Anyone who approached him boldly, and rubbed their hands upon him lovingly, would be unharmed, but if they were afraid and timorous the lion would be enraged against them.","Sometimes he even attacked, as if to say, What is this bad opinion you have of me?","A certain person, marveling at the rumor, traveled from far away to see the lion.","For a year this person endured the rigors of the road, and traveled from town to town.","After finally arriving at the thicket and spying the lion from afar, this lion seeker stood still and could advance no closer.","The people said to this person, Y ou set forth on a long road out of love for this lion.","For this creature you have struggled on for a year.","Now that you have come so close, why do you stand still?","Advance one more step!","But none of them had the courage to take a further step.","They all said, The steps we took up to here were all easy.","Yet this one step we cannot make.","What Umar desired was that step, to take one step in the presence of the lion towards the lion.","That step is a great and rare matter, the concern of only the chosen and intimate of God.","Yet this is the true step — the rest are mere footprints.","Such faith comes only to prophets who have washed their hands of their own life.","A lover is a wonderful thing.","We derive strength, life and growth from even the thought of our beloved.","Why is this surprising?","Lailas spirit gave strength to Majnun and became his food.","If her image had such power and influence over Majnun, then why should you marvel at the thought of God giving strength to Umar?","That was not a mere thought.","That was the very soul of all realities!","It is just such a thought that maintains this world.","You say reality is what you can see and perceive with your senses, otherwise you call it imagination.","The opposite it true!","This world is what is imagined.","Out of reality springs a hundred worlds like this that will rot one day and disappear.","Then a new world springs forth, even better than the last.","Reality does not become old or new.","These are but temporary expressions of what is Real.","An architect sees a building in their thoughts.","They picture it to be so tall, so long, its floor angles this way, its courtyard is shaped like this.","People do not call this imagination.","But when someone, who knows nothing about building, talks about such details, certainly that is different.","As people say, They are just imagining things.",".","It is better not to question what Sufis say, since this obliges them to invent a lie.","For if a materialist questions a Sufi, the Sufi must give some answer.","But how can they be completely truthful with someone incapable of understanding?","The materialists mouth and lips are not able to receive such a delicate morsel.","So the Sufi must answer people according to their capacity and experience, namely by inventing an answer that sends them away.","Although everything the Sufi gives out is true and cannot be a lie, yet the first thing a Sufi says is far greater.","If this is questioned, then what good is answering with more truth?","Even still, the lie given by the Sufi is good for the materialist, and more than right.","A certain dervish had a disciple who used to beg for him.","One day out of what they gained from their begging, the disciple brought some food to their master.","The dervish ate the food.","That night he had a wet dream.","Where did you get that food?","he asked the disciple.","A lovely girl gave it to me, the disciple answered.","By God, said the dervish, it is twenty years since I had a wet dream.","This is the effect of her morsel.","This shows that the dervish must be careful, they cannot eat every morsel.","The dervish is too sensitive.","Things will effect them and become visible, just as a little blackness shows on a clean white gown.","However, as for a black gown that has become black with grime for many years, if a thousand kinds of filth should trickle on it, it would make no difference.","The long entreating prayer-song of seekers and travelers tells a story of lives occupied in labor and devotion with each effort assigned to its special time.","It is as though an overseer of habit draws them to their specific task.","For example, when first rising in the morning, they give themselves to contemplation and worship while the mind is quiet and clear.","Thus, each performs the service that is suitable to them and comes within the scope of their noble Soul.","There are a hundred thousand ranks.","The purer someone becomes, the higher up they are raised.","This story of spiritual growth is a long one.","Whoever tries to shorten it would shorten their own life and Sold, but for the grace of God.","As for the prayer-songs of those who have attained union with God, I must speak within the limits of understanding — for their love and the purity of their voices attract holy spirits, pure angels, and those visitors whom none know but God — the Silent Ones whose names are hidden from the world out of exceeding jealousy.","You are seated beside them now, but you do not see them.","Neither do you hear their speech, their greetings or laughter.","Y et what is so marvelous about this?","When someone is sick, they see apparitions that others cannot see.","Yet these spiritual beings are a thousand times subtler than those apparitions, for while the average person does not see or hear such visions until they are sick, they will not see these spiritual beings before they die.","Such spiritual visitors know the refined states and majesty of the saints.","They watch from earliest morn, while a thousand other angels and pure spirits wait upon the saints.","For this reason the Silent Ones hesitate infinitely — not wanting to intervene in the midst of such a chorus, or disturb the ones they wish to honor.","Slaves are present every morning at the door of the kings palace.","Each has a fixed station, a fixed service, and a fixed devotion.","Some serve from afar, and the king does not see them nor notice them.","All the slaves know which one amongst them has the honor of the kings presence.","When the king leaves, the servants attend to that one from every gate, for there is no greater way to serve the king.","That one has taken on the characteristics of the king, and becomes the hearing and sight of the king for all the others.","This is an extremely majestic station, ineffable indeed.","The majesty of it cannot be comprehended by spelling out M-a-j-e-s-t-y.","If even a small trace of this majesty penetrated the world, the letter M would be unwritable, the sound M would be unpronounceable, nor could any hint or symbol remain.","The whole city would be devastated by the hosts of Light.","Kings, when they enter a city, disorder it.","A camel enters a house, and the house is devastated, but in that ruin there are a thousand treasures.","Only in ruins may a treasure be found.","In thriving cities a hound is still a hound.","If I have described at length the station of the seekers, how can I explain the states of those who have attained?","They have no end — only seekers have an end.","The end of all seekers is attainment.","What could be the end for those who have attained union, a union with no separation?","No ripe grape returns to an unripe grape.","No mature fruit ever becomes raw again.","Yes, it is unlawful to speak Of these things to men and women.","But once Thy Name is mentioned, O God, These words pour out for them.","By God, I will not make it long.","I will make it short.","My life is consumed, but You turn That life to wine.","You say that all is given, but take This Soul as Thine.","Whoever cuts this story short, it is as if they are abandoning the right road and taking a road into the life-destroying wilderness, where they say, These trees look like the right way home.","A Christian by the name of al-Jarrah said: A number of Sheik Sadr al-Dins companions drank with me, and they said, Jesus is God, as you claim.","We confess that to be truth, but we conceal and deny it to preserve the honor of our community.","Rumi said: God forbid!","These are the words of those drunken with the wine of Satan, the mis-guider.","How could it be that Jesus, with such a frail body, who was forced to flee from the plotting Jews, place after place, who stood less than two cubits tall, should be the preserver of the seven heavens — each with a thickness of five hundred years, and from each heaven to the next a distance of five hundred years, and every earth five hundred years, and from each earth to the next five hundred years?","And under this Throne, the sea of spirit whose depth is even greater, even many times the like of it?","How could your reason accept that the ruler of all these is the feeblest of forms?","Moreover, that before being bom, Jesus was the creator of the heavens and the earth?","Glory be to God, above what the wrongdoers assert!","The Christian said: His body was mere dust.","Dust went to dust, and pure spirit to pure spirit.","Rumi said: If the spirit of Jesus was God, where went his spirit?","Spirit returns to its Origin and Creator.","If he was himself the Origin and Creator, where should he go?","The Christian said: So we found it stated, and we took it as our religion.","Rumi answered: If you find and inherit your parents false gold, black and corrupt, do you mean you will not change it for gold of sound quality, free of alloy and adulteration?","No, you keep that gold, saying, We found it so.","Or you inherit from your parents a paralyzed hand, and you find a treatment and a physician to heal that hand.","Do you accept it?","No, instead you say, I found my hand paralyzed, and I will not change it.","Or if you find salt water on a farm where your parents died and you were brought up, but you are shown another farm whose water is sweet, whose herbs are wholesome, whose people are healthy.","Do you desire to move to that other farm and drink the sweet water that would rid you of all diseases and ailments?","No, you say, We found this farm with its salt water and its ailments, and we hold on to what we found.","God forbid!","This is not the action or the words of an intelligent person possessed of sound senses.","God gave you an intelligence of your own separate from your parents intelligence, a sight of your own other than your fathers sight, a discrimination of your own.","Why do you nullify your sight and your intelligence, following an intelligence that will mislead and destroy you?","Yutash — his father was a cobbler.","Yet when he attained the Sultans presence, learning the manner of kings and how to be Master of the Sword and the Sultan conferred on him the highest rank, he never said, I found my father a cobbler, so I do not want this post.","Give me, O Sultan, a shop in the market so I can practice cobbling.","Indeed, even a dog, for all its baseness, once it has learned to become a hunter for the Sultan, forgets how it was raised, skulking in rubbish heaps and wastelands and craving for carrion.","On the contrary, it follows the Sultans horses and pursues the game.","It is the same with the hawk.","When the Sultan has trained it, it never says, I inherited from my father desolate haunts in the mountains and the devouring of dead things, so I will not heed the Sultans drum, or his game.","If the intellect of the beast can choose something better than what it inherited from its parents, it is monstrous and horrible that a human being, superior to all the inhabitants of the earth in reason and discrimination, should be less than a beast.","We take refuge in God from that!","Certainly it is right to say that God honored Jesus and drew him close, so that whoever serves Jesus has served the Lord, whoever obeys him has obeyed the Lord.","But since God sends a prophet in every age, manifesting by their hand all that was manifested by Jesus hand and more, it behooves us to follow that prophet — not for the sake of the prophet, but for the sake of God.","Only God can be served for Its own sake.","Therefore, only God is truly loved.","Love for all else ends in God.","So, love a thing only for God, and seek a thing only for God, until in the end you come to God and love It for Itself.","To dress up the Kaaba is a vain desire, Gods presence is all the cloth you need.","Just as worn-out and ragged clothes conceal the elegance of wealth and grandeur, so excellent clothes and fine raiment conceal the mark and beauty and perfection of the saint.","When the saints clothes are in shreds and patches, then their heart is revealed.","There are heads that are adorned by crowns of gold, and there are heads whose beautiful curls are merely hidden by jewels and gold.","The curls of our hearts beloved arouse love, and love is the throne-room of the heart.","But a crown is nothing but metal and stones.","We sought everywhere for Solomons ring.","We found his wisdom far from riches.","Abandoning wealth we found that beautiful treasure.","In poverty we took our repose, and our Beloved was pleased with nothing so much as this.","Well, I am a whoremonger.","Since I was young, I have been a seller of love.","I know this destroys barriers and consumes the veils of the heart.","Love is the root of all obedience; all else is mere adornment.","If you do not sacrifice, how can you gain your hearts desire?","Giving up everything leads to annihilation, the source of all pleasures where no separation exists.","And God is with the patient.","In every shop or potion, every merchandise or trade, the end of the thread for each one of these is the need of the human spirit.","Until the need arises, the end of that thread is hidden.","With every religion, every faith, every grace, every miracle, and all the states of the prophets — the end of each thread is within us.","Until the need appears, the end of that thread remains invisible.","All things are numbered and clearly recorded.","Someone asked: Is the source of good and evil one thing or two?","Rumi said: From the point of view that they are continually at war with one another, the answer is obviously two — since a person cannot be opposed to himself.","But, from the viewpoint that evil is inseparable from good — for good is the giving up of evil, and the giving up of evil is impossible without evil, and were it not for the incitement of evil, no one would ever abandon the good — from this point of view they are not two.","The Magians said that Y azdan is the creator of good things and Ahriman is the creator of evil and hateful things.","But desirable things are never separated from hated things.","The desirable cannot exist without the hateful, since what we like is always compared to what we hate, and the more we think evil of one thing, the more we desire its opposite.","Joy is the end of sorrow; the end of sorrow without joy is impossible.","So they are one and indivisible.","Until a thing passes away, its true meaning cannot be known.","No ones life can be judged until it is finished, because what starts evil can turn out good.","And until words pass away into speech, who can know their purpose?","Whoever criticizes a Sufi in reality does the Sufi a good turn, for the Sufi shies away from praise.","The Sufi is an enemy of vanity, hence whoever speaks evil of the Sufis ego, speaks evil of the Sufis enemy, and therefore helps them.","Things become clear through their opposites.","So the Sufi knows the critic is not really their enemy, but their friend.","I am like a smiling garden surrounded by a wall of filth and thorns.","Those passing by do not see the garden; they see only the wall and ridicule it.","Why then would the garden be angry with them?","The critics only hold themselves back, because to reach the garden they must first cross the wall.","So by finding fault with the wall, they send themselves far away from the garden and work to their own destruction.","The Prophet said, I laugh as I slay, meaning he kills the unbelievers in one manner, so that unbelievers will not kill themselves in a hundred ways.","So, of course, he laughs as he slays.","The police are always in search of thieves to capture, and thieves are always running away.","It is rare indeed to find a thief that searches for the police to be captured and thrown in jail.","Thats not a natural desire for thieves.","God said to Abu Yazid, What do you desire, Abu Yazid?","He answered, I desire not to desire.","To be wholly without desire — that is not a natural desire, since a person must empty themself and cease to be.","But God wanted to perfect Abu Yazid and to make him a complete Sheikh, so that within him there would be no room for duality or separation, and only complete union and unity would prevail.","There are various classes and different ranks on the spiritual path.","Through effort and struggle, some have attained the station that can refuse every desire.","That is within the scope of some.","But to allow not even an itch of desire to enter the heart — that is not within the scope of anyone.","Only Gods love can take that out.","It is stated that after Mohammed and the Prophets revelation will not be sent down upon anyone else, but this is not true.","This is why Mohammed said, The believer sees with the Light of God.","When someone sees with Gods Light, they see all things, the first and last, the visible and invisible, for how can anything be hidden from Gods Light?","If anything is hidden, then that is not Gods Light.","Therefore this is revelation, whether they call it revelation or not.","When Uthman became caliph, he stepped up into the pulpit.","The people waited to see what he would say.","He was silent and said nothing.","He looked steadily at the people, and a state of ecstasy descended upon them so that they were unable to move, and could not tell where they were.","Not by a hundred preachings and sermons could such an excellent state have been shown to them.","Precious lessons were imparted and secrets revealed.","Until the very end, he only looked at them like this, not saying a word.","Then, just before leaving the pulpit, he said, It is better for you to have a working Imam than a speaking Imam.","What he said was the truth.","If the purpose of speaking is to communicate instruction delicately to uplift the people, that had been accomplished many times better without words.","So what Uthman said was perfectly correct.","During the time he was in the pulpit he did no external work visible to the people; he did not pray, he did not go on the pilgrimage, he did not give alms, he did not commemorate God, he did not even speak the caliphs address.","Therefore, know that work and action are not limited to the outer form only, rather these visible forms of work are merely a shadow of that true work of Soul.","The Prophet said, My Companions are like stars; Whichever of them you follow, you will be guided right.","When someone follows a star and finds their way by it, the star does not speak.","Merely by looking at the star, they discover that invisible road and reach their goal.","In the same way, it is possible by merely gazing at Gods saints to find the spiritual path.","Without words, without questioning, without speech, the purpose is achieved.","In all the world there is nothing more difficult than enduring the ridiculous.","Suppose for instance that you have studied a certain book, corrected, amended, and fully recited it.","Then someone sitting beside you reads the book all wrong.","Can you endure that?","No, it is impossible.","However, if you never read the book, it makes no difference to you whether anyone reads it wrong or right — you cannot tell the difference.","So, enduring the ridiculous is a great discipline.","The prophets and saints do not shirk discipline.","Their first discipline is to slay this self that is controlled by desires and lusts.","That is the Greater Holy War.","When they achieve this, and establish themselves in the station of security, then wrong and right become revealed to them.","Yet they are still engaged in a great struggle, for these mortals do everything wrong.","The saints see this and must endure it.","If they do not, and speak out declaring those mortals wrong, not one person in Heaven or on Earth will stand beside them.","But God bestows on the saints a great and mighty capacity to endure.","Out of a hundred wrong acts, they mention one, so that it will not become difficult to overcome.","The other mistakes they hide and even praise, saying, That wrong of yours is right, so that little by little they can overcome this ignorance.","It is the same when a teacher is teaching a child how to write.","When the child writes their first whole line, the child runs to show it to the teacher.","In the teachers eyes it is filled with mistakes, but the teacher speaks to the child kindly and encourages them, That is excellent.","You have written well.","Bravo, bravo!","Only this letter is not quite right, this is how it should be.","And this other letter looks like this.","The teacher calls a few letters wrong out of that line, and shows the child how they ought to be written.","The rest is praised, so the child will not lose heart.","The childs weakness gathers strength from that approval, and so gradually they are taught and assisted on their way.","We hope that God will grant the Amir all the designs of his heart.","We hope God will also grant the Amir those good fortunes that he does not even know of, so that when his heart sees those true gifts of God, he will be ashamed of his former wishes and desires.","That is called a true gift when we find what is beyond our own imagination.","For whatever enters a persons imagination is a measure of their ambition and capacity.","But Gods gift is a measure of Gods capacity.","What the eye has not seen, Nor the ear heard, Nor has entered into the heart of anyone.","Whatever you conceive of Gods bounty, God transcends all that.","Knowingness is the perfect Sheik.","Inspired and true thoughts are His disciples ranked according Gods closeness to them.","As each thought expands it comes nearer to knowingness and farther from doubt.","All thoughts suck milk at the breast of certainty, and grow.","Theory and practice nourish each thought until it approaches certainty.","Then thought passes away into certainty, for, in knowingness, thought no longer remains.","The sheikhs and their disciples in the world today are reflections of that Sheikh of Knowingness.","The disciples are proof that although the form of teaching changes from age to age, generation after generation, that Sheikh of Certainty and the Lovers of Truth are eternal, and never change.","Errant and doubtful thoughts are the outcast disciples of the Sheikh of Knowingness.","Every day they wander further from the truth, and fall deeper into darkness.","In their hearts is a sickness, And God increases their sickness.","The masters eat dates, but prisoners eat thorns.","Save those who return to truth.","And do righteous deeds.","God will change their evil Into good.","Every experience leads us to certainty, even acts of corruption.","Like the cunning thief who repents and joins the police force, all their thieving tricks now become a power for justice.","They are more certain than all the other policemen who were never thieves, since having stolen they know the ways of thieves.","If they should then become a Sheikh they would be perfect, the Elder of the world and the Mahdi of the age.","Everyone is in the midst of their own need.","No living creature can be separated from its need.","Their need cleaves to them closer Than their father and mother."," That need is their leash, drawing them this way and that, just like a nosering and chain.","Now, who would make a leash for themself?","That is absurd — so someone else must have made it for them.","If we are in the midst of our own need, we are also in the midst of the One who gives us that need.","If we are constantly attached to our own leash, we are always connected to the One who draws that leash.","But if our eyes are fixed upon our chain, we lose strength and hope.","Rather our eyes should be fixed on the One who draws that chain.","Then we gladly surrender and accept our limitations.","For that leash is around our neck only to reveal the One who holds it.","Stay away, they said.","Do not approach.","How can I keep away, when you are my need?","God gives elders a youthful passion that young people have no knowledge of.","Great is old age, When the grey hairs appear, And playfulness runs amok.","Such an elder sees the world with a freshness, as if it were new.","They laugh and play.","They ask, When someone passes eighty, will they play?","Will they play before eighty?","I say.","So the glory of old age is greater than Gods display.","In spring, God shows Its grace, frail and smiling.","In autumn, old age prevails.","The worldly garden is ruined.","The apparent bounty is gone.","God is beyond everything That the forces of destruction can sling.","Rumi said: I saw our friend in a dream in the form of a wild animal with the skin of a fox upon him.","He was on a small balcony, looking down the stairs.","I moved as if to grab him and he raised his hands, leaping about like this and that.","Then I saw Jalal al-Tibrizi with him in the form of a weasel.","Our friend shied away, but I caught him when he tried to bite me.","I put his head under my foot and squeezed it hard until all its contents came out.","I looked at the fineness of his skin and said, This deserves to be filled with gold and precious stones, pearls and rubies, and things even more excellent than that.","Then I said, I have taken what I wanted.","Shy away, shy one.","Go where you will, and leap whatever direction you like!","He leapt about because he feared being mastered, yet in being mastered his true happiness resides.","No doubt he was formed of meteor fragments, his heart was drenched, and he wanted to know all things.","He started out upon this road with great desires and he struggled hard to keep to the path and take refuge in it, but that is not enough.","For the Sheikh of Divine Grace is not snared with such nets, nor can such game be captured this way.","If the Sheikh of God is honest and true, he is completely free to determine who will have him.","He cannot be trapped without his free consent.","Our friend sat covertly watching for his prey, but that prey was watching him in his hidyhole, and his cunning.","That prey is a free agent whose ways have no limit.","He does not pass by every-ones hole.","He only passes the ways he, himself, has charted.","Gods earth is wide, Bat none comprehend Its knowledge, Except as It wills."," Even when such subtleties as these fell upon our friends tongue and understanding they were ruined and lost their fine essence.","Just as everything, whether corrupt or true, when it falls into a Lover of Gods mouth and comprehension is also changed, becoming swathed and wrapped up in graces and miracles.","Do you not see how the rod held in Moses hand did not remain as it was?","So, too, with the Moaning Pillar and the Stick in the hand of the Prophet, and prayer in the mouth of Moses, and iron in Davids hand — they did not remain in their original form, but were changed.","So, too, with subtleties and sacred words, when they fall into the hand of darkness and brute intellect, they are changed as well.","The Kaaba is a tavern for your prayers.","So long as it comes from you, your essence shares.","The unbeliever eats in seven stomachs, and Jalal al-Tibrizi eats in seventy stomachs.","Even if he has only one stomach, still he eats in seventy stomachs, because everything that is hateful is hateful just as everything from the beloved is beloved.","If our friend had returned, I would have sat with him and counseled him, and not left until he drove Jalal far away.","For Jalal is a corrupter of our friends faith, heart, spirit and reason.","If only Jalal had induced our friend to corrupt practices other than religion, such as drinking wine and singing girls — for those can be put right when treated by a Sheikh of Divine Grace.","But Jalal filled our friends house with prayer rugs — would that Jalal were rolled up in them and burned, so that our friend might escape from such misleading!","But Jalal has poisoned our friends trust in the Sheikh of God, ridiculing the Sheikh to his face, while our friend says nothing and destroys himself.","Jalal has snared our friend with rosaries, litanies and prayer carpets.","Perhaps one day God will open the eyes of our friend, and he will see what ruined him and drove him far away from the compassion of the Sheikh of God.","Then he will strike himself with his own hand, saying, You destroyed me.","Now I have committed these heavy crimes and evil acts.","It is exactly the way they saw it in their revelations — the foulness of my deeds, and my vile and sinful beliefs, were hidden behind my own back in the comer of my house.","I, myself, was concealing them from the Sheikh of God and burying them, while He saw everything and said, What are you hiding?","By Gods will, if I had summoned those foul forms, they would have marched out before me one by one, visibly, uncovering themselves, telling their true nature, and what they concealed within them.","May God save all those who are wronged by these highwaymen, who block the path of God by way of devotion!","Kings play polo to show the people of their city an example of the warriors skill — the lopping off of the enemies heads, rolling them around just as the balls roll in the field, the warriors frontal charge, attack and retreat.","This play in the park is only a symbol for that serious business of war.","In the same way, the people of God perform spiritual prayers and dances to show something of their inmost heart — how they follow their discipline and their path.","The singer who leads them is like the Imam at a ritual Moslem prayer.","The people follow his lead.","If he sings slowly, they dance slowly.","If he sings fast, they dance fast.","It is only a reflection of how within their hearts they follow the summoning of God.","I am amazed by those who know the Koran by heart yet understand nothing of the spiritual states of the Sufis.","As the Koran states, And do not obey every paltry asserter.","Look at the slanderers when they read this, they are exactly the ones who will say, Do not listen to So-and-so, no matter what they say, for they will act the same way against you.","Backbiter, going about with slander, Hinderer of good.","The Koran is a marvelous magician.","It speaks clearly to the ears of the hinderers so that they understand but are not one whit wiser.","They dont even catch an inkling of the Korans true delights.","How wonderfully gracious God is!","It sets a seal on those who listen and do not understand, argue and yet learn nothing.","God is gracious.","Its wrath is gracious, and even Its lock is gracious.","But Its lock is nothing next to Its unlocking, for the grace of that is indescribable.","If I shatter into pieces, it is through the infinite grace of Gods unlocking.","Beware, do not think I am sick and dying.","That is only a veil.","My slayer is this grace of Gods and Its incomparableness.","The dagger of illness flashes forth to distract the eyes of strangers, so that no profane and defiled eyes can perceive Its secret slaying.","All forms spring from Love, as branches spring forth from their root.","No branch can exist without its root.","Therefore, God is not called a form, since form is the branch.","How can God be called a branch?","Someone said: Love too cannot be expressed or experienced without form.","Hence it is the branch of form.","Why cannot Love be a form without form?","On the contrary, Love is the sculptor of form.","A hundred thousand forms are raised up on Loves pottery wheel.","Although a painter cannot exist without paintings, still painting is the branch and the painter is the root.","As the finger moves, so moves the ring.","Until someone has love for a house, no architect will draw up designs.","In the same way, com is at the price of gold one year, another year it is at the price of dust.","The form of the com is the same — therefore its value comes from love.","The sciences you study with such love — in your eyes they are valuable.","But when no one pursues them and no one wants to learn from them, then who will teach those sciences?","Someone said: Love is the want and need for a certain thing.","Hence the need is the root, and that thing needed is its branch.","These words of yours are also spoken out of need.","First you had the desire for these words, then they were born.","So the need existed first and then your words were born from it.","This means your need existed, in the beginning, without any words.","Therefore, love and need are not the branches of words.","Someone said: But after all, the goal of that need was these words, so how can the goal be the branch?","The branch is always the goal.","The trees roots exist for the sake of its branches.","Rumi said: The stories that have been spread against this girl are lies and should go no further.","But I can see that even though we may put aside these rumors as false, something has settled in the imagination.","Our imagination and heart are like a vestibule — thoughts first enter the vestibule, then they move into the house.","This whole world is like one house, and every image that lodges in our deepest thoughts must appear and become visible in the house.","For instance, this house in which we are seated — the form of it first became visible in the heart of the architect, then this house came into being.","Imagination, daydreams and thoughts are the vestibule of this house.","Whatever you see entering the vestibule, know that one day it will become visible in the house.","And all these things, good and evil alike that you see in the world today, all first appeared in the vestibule before becoming visible here.","When God wishes to produce rare and wonderful things in this world; orchards, gardens, meadows and sciences, It first implants the desire and demand for them in our inward hearts.","And so, everything you see in this world existed first in that inner world.","For instance, what you see in the dew also exists in the ocean, for this dew is from that ocean.","In the same way this creation of heaven and earth, and all the other marvels, God implanted the desire for these in the spirits of the ancients, and so the world came into being accordingly.","The philosophers who say that the world is eternal — how can they be taken seriously?","Their statement simply means the world was never created in time, and this claim is impossible to prove.","But those who say it is created in time; they are the saints and the prophets who are more ancient than the world.","God implanted desire for the world within their spirits, and only then did the world appear.","So they know for a fact and report out of their own experience that the world was created in time.","For instance, those of us who watched when this house was built know it did not exist until a few years ago.","If living creatures were bom in this house, such as scorpions, mice, snakes and other creatures, to them this house was already standing.","If they should say, This house is eternal, that is no proof to us, for we saw when this house was created.","Termites and ants that have grown up in the walls and woodwork know nothing else, just as the people who have grown up within the house of this world.","Here they sprout up, and here they will die, knowing nothing else.","If they say that the world is eternal, that is no proof to the prophets and saints who existed millions of years before the world.","Why speak of years?","This is no place for numbers of years...","they are infinite and beyond counting.","They saw this world come into existence, just as you have seen when this house was first raised.","The Prophet was seated with his Companions.","Some unbelievers began to denounce and lecture him.","He said, Well, you all agree there is one person in the world who receives revelation.","Revelation descends upon him — it does not descend on everyone.","That person has certain marks and signs in his actions and words, and in his mien and in every part of him the token and mark can be seen.","Since you have seen those tokens, turn your faces towards him and hold to him firmly, so he can be your protector.","They were all confounded by his argument and were left with nothing more to say.","So they put their hands on their swords and began to threaten, forment and insult his Companions.","The Prophet said, Be patient, so they cannot say they have prevailed over us.","They want to make the religion manifest by force.","God will manifest this religion.","For some time the Companions prayed and pronounced the name of Mohammed secretly.","Then after a while the revelation came; You too unsheathe the sword and make war!","Mohammed is not called unlettered because he was incapable of writing or reading.","He is called unlettered because with him writing and wisdom were innate, not taught.","He who inscribes characters on the face of the moon, is such a man not able to write?","And what is there in all the world that he does not know, seeing that all people learn from him?","What can the partial intellect know that the Universal Intellect does not possess?","The fact that we compose books and create buildings is nothing new.","We have seen this done before, and we merely add to what we have already seen.","But those who bring into this world something new of their own account, they are the Universal Intellect.","We are capable of learning and need to be taught.","The Universal Intellect is the teacher, and is not in need.","So, if we investigate all trades, at the root and origin of them all is revelation.","We have learned everything from the prophets and the Universal Intellect.","When Cain slew Abel and did not know what to do next, he saw a raven kill another raven, dig the earth, and bury the body, scattering dust on its head.","Cain learned from the raven how to make a grave and how to bury the dead.","So it is with all the professions.","Everyone who possesses a partial intellect is in need of learning, and the Universal Intellect is the source they are seeking.","The prophets and saints have united the partial intellect and Universal Intellect so the two have become one.","For instance, the foot learns from the mind how to walk.","The hand learns from the heart how to embrace.","The eye and ear leam how to see and hear.","If the heart and mind did not exist, how could the body function?","This body is coarse and gross compared to both mind and heart.","Without their subtlety and freshness, the body remains useless and crude.","So the partial intellect is like a tool for the Universal Intellect, and we leam and find our purpose from there.","Someone said, Remember us in your intention.","Intention is the root of the matter.","If there are no words, let there be no words.","Words are the branch.","Rumi said: Well, intention first exists in the inner world before entering this world of form.","So if form does not matter, what is the purpose of this world?","If you plant only the kernel of an apricot stone, nothing will grow.","If you plant it with its husk, then it becomes a tree.","From this we know that form also has a function.","Yes, prayer is an inward matter: There is no prayer without the heart being present.","But it is still necessary to bring the prayer into form.","With outward words, genuflection, and prostration, you gain benefit and attain your desire.","The outer form of prayer is temporary, the inner spirit never ends.","For the Spirit of the world is an infinite ocean, the body but a limited shore.","Therefore, continual prayer belongs only to the spirit, but that inward prayer must manifest.","Until intention and form are wedded, there are no children bom.","When you say that words are the branch, this is only a relative term.","Until the branch exists how can the term root gain its meaning?","So the meaning of root came out of this branch.","If the branch had not existed, it could never have had a name.","When you speak of woman, there must also be man.","When you speak of a Master, there must be a student.","When you speak of the Ruler, there must be one ruled.","Husam al-Din Arzanjani, before entering the service and society of dervishes, was a great debater.","Wherever he went, he engaged vigorously in argument and controversy.","He used to debate well and spoke excellently, but once he took up the company of dervishes his heart turned completely against debate.","Whoever desires to sit next to God, let them sit with lovers of God.","These intellectual sciences are a game and a waste of life, compared to the spiritual experiences of the dervishes.","This way of desirelessness is the way to attain your desires.","Whatever you have longed for will come to you on this path, whether the shattering of armies, victory over your enemy, capturing kingdoms, bringing people to obedience, excelling your contemporaries, or elegance of speech.","When you have chosen the way of poverty, these things come to you.","No one has ever traveled this road and had cause to complain, contrary to other ways where only one out of a hundred thousand reach their goal, and even they do not always find happiness and peace.","For every desire has many branching paths to reach that goal.","It is long and arduous, full of pitfalls and obstacles, and in the end it is possible those twisting paths will fall short of your desire.","However, once you enter the world of poverty and practice it, God bestows on you kingdoms and worlds you never imagined, and you feel quite ashamed of what you longed for at first.","Ah!","you cry.","With such reality in existence, how could I have sought after such foolishness?","But God says, If only you had risen above such desires, becoming detached from them and seeing them for what they were, all would have been well.","Yet now, when they enter your thoughts and you avoid them for My sake, My grace is infinite, so of course I make them attainable to you.","So it happened with Mohammed.","Before he attained his goal and became famous, he listened to the elegant speech and eloquence of the Arabs, and he wished that he too could speak so well.","Yet, once the invisible worlds were revealed to him, and he became drunk with God, his heart turned completely against that desire and longing.","God declared, I have given you the elegance and eloquence that you sought.","The Prophet answered, Lord, of what use are they to me?","I am indifferent to them and have no desire for them.","God replied, Do not worry.","Your original desire shall come to pass, and yet your indifference will remain, so that desire cannot harm you.","God bestowed on him such speech that the entire world, from his time until today, has composed and still composes volumes expounding it, and yet people fall short of comprehending all that it contains.","God also declared, Your Companions, out of weakness and fear for their lives, whisper your name only in secret.","But I will publish your greatness abroad so that men and women will shout it aloud in sweet intonations five times daily on the high minarets in all regions of the world.","Your name will be famous in the east and the west.","It is the same with anyone who gambles their life upon this way, to them all objectives whether religious or mundane become attainable.","None have ever had cause to complain.","The words of the Saints are the true coin; the words of others are but imitation.","Imitation is a branch of the true coin.","Imitation is like a wooden carving in the shape of a foot, that wooden foot was filched from a real foot and shaped to its measure.","If no foot existed, how could there be a copy?","Therefore some speech is true coin, and some imitation.","They resemble each other.","Only discrimination can recognize the difference.","This critical perception is real faith.","Do you not see how Moses threw down his rod and it became a serpent, and the staffs and ropes of the magicians also became serpents, but Pharaoh who lacked insight saw no difference between them, while Moses who possessed discernment could see truth from sorcery?","Through discrimination Moses became a believer.","So we realize that faith is discrimination.","The root of our judgement is Divine revelation.","But after mingling with the thoughts, senses and desires of mortal creatures, that original grace has vanished.","How does our judgement resemble the delicacy of revelation now?","This is like the water that flows in Turut towards the city.","There, at its fountainhead, see how pure and fine it is!","But once it enters the city, and passes through the gardens, quarters and houses of the inhabitants, so many people wash their hands, faces, feet and others parts in it, and their clothes and carpets, and the urine of all the people and the dung of horses and mules is poured into it.","Look at this water when it passes out the other side of the city!","It is still the same water, able to turn dust into clay, quench the thirsty, make the field green, yet discrimination can see the water is polluted and has lost its original clarity.","Water that never grows stale — that is what we need.","Water that can cleanse the impurities of the world, and yet they leave no trace in it.","It retains its limpid and clear state, and is never tainted.","This is the Water of Truth.","So, faith is discrimination, distinguishing truth from falsehood and the true coin from the fake.","These words are valuable to everyone possessing that critical perception, but are wasted on those who cannot see the difference.","If these words fall into the hands of those who cannot discern, it is like giving precious pearls to children who do not know their value.","Later, if you offer them apples they will gladly trade them for pearls, since they know no better.","Abu Yazid, when a child, was taken by his father to school to learn jurisprudence.","When he was brought before the schoolmaster he asked, Is this the jurisprudence of God?","They said, This is the jurisprudence of Abu Hanifa.","He said, I want the jurisprudence of God.","When he was brought before the grammar teacher, he asked, Is this the grammar of God?","The teacher said, This is the grammar of Sibawaihi.","Abu Yazid said, I do not want it.","He spoke this way wherever his father took him.","His father could do nothing with him, and finally let him be.","Later he came to Baghdad upon his quest, and as soon as he saw Junaid he shouted, This is the jurisprudence of God!","How could it be that a lamb would not recognize its own mother on whose milk it has been suckled?","So, forget the form.","There was a certain Sheikh who kept his disciples standing with their hands folded in service.","They asked him, Sheikh, why do you not let this class sit down?","This is not the practice of dervishes, this is the custom of princes and kings.","He replied, No.","Be silent.","You must respect this way to gain full benefit.","Though respect lies within the heart, yet the outer is the frontispiece of the inner.","From the frontispiece of a book, people know what it contains.","From outward respect, bowing the head and standing, can be seen what respect they have inwardly, and their respect for God.","Jauhar, the Sultans servant, said, We have been told that we must repeat the Muslim credo five times during our lifetime.","What if we dont understand the words, or do not memorize them correctly?","After death, what questions will we be asked, seeing that we have forgotten even the questions we were taught?","Rumi replied: If you forget what you have learned, then of course you become a clean slate suitable for questions that you have not learned.","Now, this minute, you are listening to me.","You accept some part of what I say because you have heard similar things before, but some you only half accept, and concerning other things you hesitate.","No one hears this rejection or acceptance, or the debate going on within you.","Even though you are listening, no sound or voice comes to your ear from within you.","If you search inwardly, you will find no instrument of speech.","This coming of yours, to visit me, is itself a question without a throat or tongue, namely, Show me a way, and explain what you have shown.","My sitting with you, whether silent or speaking, is an answer to your hidden questions.","When you wait upon the king, that is a question addressed to the king and an answer.","Every day the king questions his servants without tongue: How do you stand?","How do you eat?","How do you look?","If anyone has a wry look within them, their answer inevitably comes out awry and they cannot give a straight answer.","In the same way someone who stammers, however much they wish to speak straight, is unable to do so.","A goldsmith who mbs gold against a stone is questioning the gold, and gold answers, This is I.","I am pure.","Or, I am alloyed.","The crucible knows after you ve been tested Whether you are gold, Or merely copper with gold covering.","Hunger is a questioning of nature: There is a crack in the bodys house.","Give a brick.","Give clay.","Eating is an answer: Take.","Not eating is also an answer: Wait until later.","The brick is not yet dry.","The physician comes and takes our pulse.","That is a question — the throbbing of the vein is the answer.","Examining the urine is an unspoken question and answer.","To cast a seed into the ground is a question: Will you give fruit?","The growing of the tree is an answer without a tongue.","Because the answer is wordless, the question must be wordless, too.","A king read three letters from the same man, but did not answer.","The subject wrote a complaint, saying, Three times now I have petitioned your majesty.","Let your majesty at least say whether my petition has been accepted or rejected.","The king wrote on the back of the letter, Do you not know that refusing an answer is an answer itself, and that the answer to a fool is silence?","A trees not growing is a refusal to answer, and is an answer itself.","Every motion people make is a question.","Whatever happens to them, whether sorrow or joy, is an answer.","If they hear a pleasant answer, they show their thanks.","Thanks is expressed by asking the same kind of question again.","If they hear an unpleasant answer, they quickly ask Gods forgiveness and do not repeat that kind of question.","If only, when Our might came upon them, They had been humble!","But their hearts were hard."," In other words, they did not understand that the answer they received came from the question they asked.","And Satan decked out fair to them What they were doing."," This means they saw the answer to their question but said, This ugly answer is not appropriate to our fair question.","They did not realize that smoke comes from the fuel, not the fire.","The drier the fuel, the cleaner the flame.","If you entrust your garden to a gardener, and you smell a disagreeable odor, suspect the gardener and not the garden.","Someone said, Why did you kill your mother?","The other answered, I saw her sleeping with a strange man.","The first person said, You should have killed the stranger.","The second one said, Then I would be killing someone every day.","Therefore, whatever happens to you, correct your own self, then you will not have to fight with someone every day.","If others say, Everything is from God, we reply: Then to reproach ones own self and to let the world be is also from God.","This is like the story of a boy who shook down apricots from a tree and ate them.","The owner of the orchard caught him and said, Arent you afraid of Gods punishment?","The boy said, Why should I be afraid?","The tree belongs to God, and I am Gods servant.","Gods servant ate Gods fruit!","The owner said, Wait and see what answer I shall give you.","Fetch a rope, tie him to this tree and beat him until the answer is made clear!","The boy said, Arent you afraid of Gods punishment?","The owner answered, Why should I be afraid?","You are Gods servant, and this is Gods stick.","I am beating Gods servant with Gods stick!","The moral is that this world is like an echo — whatever you say, whether good or evil, you hear the same from the mountain.","If you think, I spoke beautifully and the mountain gave an ugly answer, this is impossible.","When the nightingale sings in the mountain, does the mountain return the voice of a raven or a donkey?","Know for certain then that you have spoken like a donkey!","Speak sweetly when crossing the mountain pass, Why do you bray like an ass?","The azure sky sends back the note, Of sweetness from your own throat.","We are like bowls on the surface of the water.","The direction a bowl moves is controlled not by the bowl, but by the water.","Someone said: That is a general statement.","But some people know they are on the surface of the water, while some do not know.","Rumi said: If that is a general statement, then the specific statement, The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the All-Merciful would mean nothing.","It was also said, The All-Merciful has taught the Koran.","This cannot be a general statement.","God taught all the sciences, so what is this particular reference to the Koran?","Similarly, He created the heavens and the earth.","Why specifically the heavens and the earth, since He created all things?","True, all bowls travel on the surface of the water of Omnipotence and Divine Will, but it is poor manners to refer to God as O Creator of dung and farting and windbreaking.","Instead we say, O Creator of the heavens, and O Creator of intelligence.","So this distinction, although general, is an indication of choiceness and value.","The upshot is that the bowls travel on the surface of the water, and the water carries one bowl so that every other bowl gazes upon it.","The water carries another bowl so that every bowl runs away instinctively, and feels ashamed seeing it.","The water inspires them to run away and implants in them the power to move away, saying, O God, take us farther away.","But in the first case they say, O God, bring us closer to this one.","The person who thinks this is a general situation says, Both bowls are equally controlled by the water.","We say, If only you saw the grace, beauty and pretty sauntering of this bowl on the water, you would have no desire to call such movement general.","In the same way, it would never occur to a lover to say, My beloved and I are co-partners in the work and filth that results from two people sharing a certain space with bodies that decay.","How could anyone apply such a cold description to their beloved?","Since you only recognize the general attributes, not seeing our particular beauty, it is not proper arguing with you, for our words are commingled with beauty and it is wrong to reveal beauty to those who do not love beauty.","This is the science of potential, it is not the science of argumentation.","Roses and fruit-blossoms do not bloom in the autumn, for that would confront and compete with autumn.","It is not in the nature of the rose to confront autumn.","If the sun has done its work, the rose comes out in its proper season, otherwise it draws in its head and retires within its stem.","Autumn says to it, If you are not barren, confront me!","The rose says, In your presence I am barren and a coward.","Say whatever you will!","O monarch of all truthful folk, How can I be called a hypocrite?","With living people I am alive, And with the dead as dead I sit.","If some old crone without any teeth, her face all wrinkled like the back of a lizard, came to you and said, If you are a man and a true youth, behold, I have come before you!","Behold the horse and the fair one that sits upon it.","Behold the open field.","Show manliness, if you are a man!","You would say, God be my refuge!","I am no man.","What they have told you is all lies.","If you are the mate, unmanliness is most attractive!","A scorpion comes and raises its stinger against your leg, saying, I have heard you are someone who laughs and is happy.","Laugh, so that I can hear your laughter.","In such a case you would say, Now that you have come I have no laughter.","What they have told you is lies.","My desire to laugh has been replaced with the hope that you will go far away!","Someone said to Rumi: When you sighed a moment ago, the ecstasy departed.","Do not sigh, so the ecstasy will not leave.","Rumi answered: Sometimes that ecstasy departs if you do not sigh.","Otherwise, Mohammed would not have said, Abraham was a man who sighed, a merciful man.","Nor would it be right to show any act of obedience to God, for all displays of obedience are ecstasy.","You say this because you want the ecstasy to continue.","When someone induces ecstasy, you look after them to continue your experience.","This is like shouting to a sleeper, Arise!","It is day.","The caravan is off.","Others say, Dont shout.","She is in ecstasy.","You will drive her ecstasy away.","You answer, That ecstasy of sleep is destruction, this ecstasy of wakefulness is birth and growth.","They say, Dont make a confusion, for this shouting is disturbing.","You answer, This shouting will make the sleeper think.","How can she think while sleeping?","So shouting is of two kinds.","If the shouters are greater in knowledge, their shouting will cause an increase in thought.","Since they are people of knowledge and of wakefulness, when they awaken others out of their slumber they show the sleepers their own world and draw them higher.","However, when the awakener is lower in awareness and awakens others, the gaze of those sleeping is pulled down.","Since the shouters knowledge is lower down, inevitably the gaze of those shouted at drops downward to the lower world.","People who are interested in their scholarly studies think that if they faithfully attend our meetings they will forget and lose all they have learned.","On the contrary, when they come here their sciences acquire soul.","For all sciences, when they acquire soul, are like an empty body that springs to life.","The heart of knowledge originates beyond this world of letters and language.","It comes to us from that world where speech is without sound or sign.","And to Moses, God spoke directly.","Well, God did not speak with letters and sounds, with throat and tongue.","Letters require a throat and lips to be heard.","God is exalted far above lips, mouth and throat.","So prophets in that world speak with God in a way that partial intelligences cannot imagine or understand.","Yet the prophets come down from that world without letters into this world of letters, and become children for the sake of these children.","Thus, Mohammed said, I was sent as a teacher.","Although the masses of people in this world do not reach the spiritual states of the prophets, still this world derives strength from the saints, and grows and finds comfort in them.","In the same way, an infant, not knowing or recognizing its mother in detail, still finds comfort and derives strength from her.","Just as the fruit is nourished by the branch, becoming sweet and ripe, yet knows nothing of the tree.","So, the great saints, with their letters and speech, though the masses do not know them, still the people gain strength from the saints and are nourished.","There is fixed within soul — beyond reason, letter and sound — a macrocosm.","But look at how many seek out those demented gurus who make outrageous claims.","People think, what these gurus say may be true.","Such things might exist, even if they are wrong in this case.","Not everything can be known by reason and logic.","But this does-nt mean that everything outside of reason and logic is true.","Every nut is round, but not every round thing is a nut, is a sign of that.","Although a saint has a state that cannot be expressed through words and writing, still from the saints presence reason grows and develops.","This cannot be found from those demented ones around whom the masses circle.","No one who visits them is transformed beyond their own state, and no one finds completeness through such guidance.","People might think they have found completeness, but that is not what we call completeness.","Just like a child who is separated from its mother finds comfort for a moment with someone else, this is not what we call comfort, since the child has simply made a mistake.","Physicians say that whatever is agreeable to the temperament and brings satisfaction gives strength and purifies the blood.","However, this is only true when someone is without disease.","For instance, a bilious person finds sour things agreeable, and sugar disagreeable, because their taste has become changed by their own distemper.","And so the truly agreeable is what is agreeable to someone before they fall sick.","For example, a woman breaks her hand and then hangs it in a sling so that it heals all crooked.","Her surgeon must make the bones straight and set them to their original form.","This is not agreeable to the woman.","Indeed, she finds it painful.","Being crooked is much more agreeable to her.","So the surgeon says, First of all your hand was straight, and you found comfort in that.","When you broke it, you felt pain and suffered.","Although being crooked is more agreeable to you now, this comfort is false and means nothing.","Beings in the world of pure spirit find the commemoration of God and absorption in God agreeable, like the angels.","However, if they fall sick through connection with the body, and eating sour things becomes agreeable to them, then the prophets and saints who are physicians, say, This is not really what you want.","This agreeableness is a lie.","Your real desire is for something else that you have forgotten.","What is agreeable to your original and sound temperament is what you truly want.","But since this sickness now seems appealing, you do not recognize the truth.","A Sufi was seated before a grammarian.","The grammarian said, A word must be one of three things: either it is a noun, a verb, or a particle.","The Gnostic fore his robe and cried, Alas!","Twenty years of my life striving and seeking have gone to the winds, for I labored in the hope that there was another word beyond this.","Now you have destroyed my hope.","Though the Sufi had already attained the Word he sought, he said this to arouse the grammarian.","The greater the number of guests, the larger they make the house, the more furniture they bring in, and the more food they prepare.","This is why the stature of little children is small, and their thoughts too, which are their guests, are appropriate to the house of their bodies.","They know nothing except milk and their nurses.","When they grow older the guests, their thoughts, also increase, and their house of reason, perception and discrimination expands.","When the guests of passionate love arrive, they are too much for the house.","They demolish it and build anew.","Gods veils and Gods scouts and troops cannot be contained in Gods house.","Gods veils cannot hide Its door.","To accommodate infinite guests, an infinite station is required.","When Gods veils are hung, they shed light and dissolve all shadows, so that the secret things become manifest.","This is opposite of the veils in this present world, that add to the shadows.","I suffer wrongs that will not be said.","None will hear my excuse or cries.","Just as the candle weeps, No one knows if the tears it sheds, Come from its closeness to the fire Or the longing of the bee s wax for the honey s sweetness, now parted.","This whole world is the prisoner of destiny, and destiny is the prisoner of beauty.","Beauty reveals, it does not conceal.","God has certain servants that are men who, when they see a woman in a veil, command her, Remove your veil so we may see your face and who you are.","When you pass by veiled, we are distracted, wondering, What manner of person is this that passes before us.","We are not like those who are attracted and enslaved by you if they see your face.","It has been a long time now that God has made us innocent and free from such charms.","We are quite secure.","You will not disturb us or tempt us.","But it is when we do not see you that we are disturbed, wondering, Who is this?","These men are very different from others who are driven by their desires.","If other men see the faces of beauty, they are captivated and become disturbed.","Therefore, it is better for these beauties to hide themselves, so as not to tempt such men.","As for the Sufis, however, it is better to show their faces, to spare Gods servants the distraction.","Someone said: In Khvarizm, no one falls in love, because in Khvarizm there are many beautiful women.","No sooner do they see a beauty and fix their hearts on her, than they see another still more beautiful, and the first one is forgotten.","Rumi said: If there are no lovers for the beauties of Khvarizm, then certainly there are lovers of Khvarizm, itself, seeing the many beauties in that land.","But the KhvarizmI speak of is poverty, where countless mystical and spiritual forms show their faces.","Each one you turn to and find comfort in, leads to yet another more beautiful, so that you forget all before.","On and on this leads — ad infinitum.","So let us be lovers of poverty, where such true beauties are found.","Our friend, Saif al-Bukhari has gone to Egypt.","Everyone likes a mirror, and is in love with reflections of their own attributes and attainments, but our friend misses the true nature of his face.","He thinks this bodily veil is a face, and the mirror of this veil is the mirror of his face.","Uncover your face, so you can know for sure that I am a mirror of your true self.","Someone said: I know for a fact that the prophets and saints are all victims of a false presumption.","There is nothing to it but mere pretense.","Rumi said: Do you say this at random, or have you looked into this before speaking?","If you have looked into this, then this pretension you have seen is itself a vision, and therefore a proof of their vision.","Indeed, such knowingness is the most precious and noblest thing in existence.","The proof of the prophets message is simply their own claim to such vision, which you have acknowledged yourself.","Such vision only manifests through great longing and seeking.","Your own statement still portrays the existence of a seeker, desire and vision.","Thus, the relationship between seekers and God is a case where all disclaimers of love prove only love.","They say, That crowd are disciples of a dimwit, and venerate the fool.","I say, That dimwit of a Sheikh is no less than a stone or an idol.","Those who worship stones venerate and magnify them.","They direct their hopes and longings toward them, and their petitions, needs and tears.","The stone knows nothing, nor can it feel anything of this.","Yet God has made stones and idols to be the means of devotion, of which the stones and idols are totally unaware.","In the same way, these disciples are in love with the image of this foolish Sheikh, and the Sheikh is oblivious to their banishment, union and all the phases of their love life.","If misguided and misdirected love for a phantom can produce ecstasy, still it is nothing like the mutual love enjoyed with a real beloved, who is aware and wide awake to the lovers condition.","Like the person who embraces a pillar in the dark, thinking it to be their beloved, the pleasure they enjoy cannot be compared with one who embraces their living and conscious friend.","Everyone who sets out on a journey has a particular idea in mind: Once I arrive I will be able to gain advantages and improve my affairs.","My business will be set in order, my friends will be delighted, and I shall defeat my enemies.","Such are the ideas we have in mind, but Gods objective is something else.","We make so many plans and think through so many ideas, and not one turns out according to our desire.","Yet even with all of that, we continue to rely upon our own plans and choices.","Ignoring Fate, people plot their little plans.","Gods Will does not consult with the plans of man.","This is illustrated by the woman who sees in a dream that she has chanced into a strange city where no one knows her, and she knows no one else.","She becomes bewildered, and depressed, saying to herself, Why did I come to this city where I have no friend nor acquaintance to shake me by the hand, or press me on the lip?","On awakening, this city and its people vanish, and she realizes that all her anguish and sorrow were over nothing.","So she disregards the state she found herself in, thinking her worries were quite wasted.","However, the next time she falls asleep, she sees herself in exactly such a city again, and begins to feel the same sorrow and loneliness.","She regrets coming to such a city and doesnt remember when she was awake how foolish she see it was to worry, since it was only a dream and nothing to grieve about.","This is exactly how people are.","They have seen their desires come to nothing a hundred thousand times.","Nothing proceeds according to their intricate plans.","But God appoints an oblivion to cover their eyes, so they forget all that has happened, and once again they plan out their own ideas and wills.","God stands between people and their hearts.","Once, when Ibrahim, son of Adham, was king, he galloped in the track of a deer he was hunting, until he became entirely separated from his soldiers, leaving them far behind.","His horse was weary and covered with sweat, but still he chased on.","After passing far into the desert wilderness, the deer suddenly stopped, turned back its face and said, You were not created for this.","Beingness was not brought forth from not-being for you to hunt me.","Even if you catch me, what will you have accomplished?","When Ibrahim heard these words, he cried aloud and flung himself from the horse.","There was no one in that desert except a shepherd.","Ibrahim said to him, Take my royal robes encrusted with jewels, my arms and my horse, and give me your gown of coarse cloth.","And please tell no one, not even a hint to anyone, what has become of me.","He put on the rough gown and set out on his way.","Now consider what his intention was, and yet what his true objective turned out to be!","He wanted to catch a deer, but God caught him by means of that deer.","Therefore, realize that in this world things happen as God wills.","His is the design, and all purpose comes from Him.","Before becoming a Muslim, Umar entered his sisters house.","His sister was chanting from the Koran in a loud voice: TA HA: We have not sent down.",".",".","When she saw her brother she immediately hid the Koran, and became silent.","Umar bared his sword saying, Tell me what you were reading and why you hid it or this very instant I will chop off your head!","His sister feared him, knowing his temper when angry, and in terror for her life she confessed, I was reading from these words that God revealed to Mohammed.","Read on, so that I can hear, said Umar, and she recited the whole of the Sura of Ta Ha.","Umar became furious, and in a rage he waved his sword, saying, If I killed you this instant, it would be a killing of the defenseless.","First I will go and cut off Mohammeds head, then I will attend to you.","In his anger, holding a naked sword, Umar set off for the Prophets mosque.","The chieftains of Quraish, seeing him go by, exclaimed, Wonderful!","Umar is after Mohammed.","Surely, if anyone can stop this new religion, Umar can.","For Umar was a mighty and powerful man.","Any army he marched against was vanquished.","In fact, the Prophet had many times declared, God, succor my religion by means of Umar or Abu Jahl.","For those two were famous in that time for strength and heroism.","Afterwards, when Umar became a Muslim, he used to weep and say, O Messenger of God, woe for me if you had spoken Abu Jahls name before mine.","What would have become of me then?","I would have continued in error.","In short, Umar was on his way, with naked sword, making for the Prophets mosque.","Meanwhile Gabriel revealed to Mohammed, Lo, Messenger of God, Umar is coming to be converted to Islam.","Take him to your bosom.","Just as Umar entered the door of the mosque, he saw clearly an arrow of light fly from Mohammed, and pierce his heart.","Umar uttered a loud cry and fell down insensible.","Love and passionate desire filled him, and he wanted to dissolve himself into Mohammed out of extreme affection, and he became nothing.","He said, Prophet of God, offer me your faith and speak your blessed word, so I may hear.","Having become a Muslim, he said, Now, to correct my actions of coming against you with a bared sword, and to cleanse that act, henceforth I will give quarter to no one I hear speaking wrongly of you.","With this sword I will strike their heads from their bodies.","Coming out of the mosque, he suddenly encountered his father.","His father said, You have changed religion.","Immediately he struck off his fathers head, and walked on holding the bloodstained sword.","The chieftains of Quraish, seeing the blood, said to Umar, You promised to bring back Mohammeds head.","Where is his head?","Umar said, I carry it with me!","One of them said, You brought his head?","He answered, No, not that head.","The head I bring is from the other side.","Now look at what Umar planned, and what God brought about from those plans.","Know that all affairs turn out as God desires.","Abraham said, O God, since you have chosen me and honored me with the robe of Your approval, grant this distinction to my children also.","God declared: My covenant shall not reach the evildoers.","When Abraham realized that God does not extend His loving care to the evildoers and the insolent, he tried to strike a bargain.","He said, O God, those who believe and are not evildoers — give them a portion of Your provision.","God declared, My provision is common to all men and women, and everyone shall have a share of it.","All creatures enjoy their portion of benefits from this guesthouse.","But the robe of My approval, and the honor of ennoblement and distinction, are a special gift for the elect and chosen ones.","We appointed the House to be A place of visitation for the people, And a sanctuaiy.","Take to yourselves Abraham s station For a place of prayer.","The literalists say that what is intended by this House is the Kaaba, for in the Kaaba it is forbidden to hunt, and no malice is allowed against anyone.","God singled out that House for Itself.","This is all perfectly true and fine, but that is the literal interpretation of the Koran.","However, the Sufis say that the House is the inward part of our beingness.","In other words, God, free my inward self of temptation and worldly plans.","Cleanse it of passions and idle thoughts, so that no fear can enter in and security will prevail.","Let it become completely the center of Your revelation.","It is said that God has appointed meteors to watch over heaven to prevent the accursed Satans from listening to the secrets of the angels.","The meaning of this, according to esotericists, is, O God, appoint the guardian of Your loving care to watch over our inward house, to drive away from us the temptation of the Satans and the tricks of the carnal desires.","Everyone begins this path from their own place.","The Koran is a doublesided brocade.","Some enjoy one side, and some the other.","Both are true, since God desires that everyone should gain benefit from it.","In the same way, a woman has a husband and a child.","Each enjoys her in a different way.","The childs pleasure is in her breast and her milk.","The husbands pleasure is in intercourse with her.","Some people are infants of the Way — they take pleasure in the literal meaning of the Koran, and drink that milk.","But those who have reached years of full discretion have another enjoyment and a different understanding of the inner meanings of the Koran.","Abrahams station and place of prayer is a certain spot in the Kaaba where the literalists say two inclinations of prayer must be performed.","This is excellent indeed, by God.","But according to the Sufis, Abrahams station is that inward state where you should cast yourself into the fire for Gods sake, reaching this place through work and effort in Gods name.","There, people can sacrifice themselves for the sake of God, their own selves having no place in their sight, and they cease to tremble for themselves.","To perform two inclinations of prayer at Abrahams station is excellent, but let the standing be performed in this world, and the bowing be in the other world.","The true Kaaba is the heart of the prophets and the saints, the locus of Gods revelation.","The physical Kaaba is a branch of that.","If it were not for the heart, of what use would the Kaaba be?","The prophets and the saints forsake their own desire and follow the desire of God.","Whatever God commands, they do.","Whoever God denies grace, to them the saints are indifferent — indeed in their eyes such a one is an enemy.","Into Your hands we give the reins of our heart.","Whatever you declare cooked, we declare it burnt!","Everything I say is a comparison.","Comparison is one thing, and equivalence is another.","We liken Gods Light to a lamp for the sake of comparison, and the saints are likened to the glass of that lamp.","Gods Light is not contained by any being or space, so how can it be contained in a glass lamp?","How can the compass of His Light be contained in a heart?","Yet seeking, you find it in the heart.","Not like some box where that Light resides, but from the heart you find that Light radiating.","Like you find your image in a mirror, yet your image is not in the mirror itself.","Still, when you look in the mirror you see yourself.","By means of comparison all subtleties become intelligible, and once it is intelligible the senses can grasp it.","Thus, they say that in the other world books will fly, some into the right hand and some into the left.","There are also angels, the Throne, Heaven and Hell, the Balance, the Reckoning, and the Book: none of this is clear until an analogy is given.","There is no likeness to any of these things in this world, yet through comparison they can be known.","For example, by night all people sleep, cobbler and king alike, judge and tailor.","Once asleep, their thoughts take wing, and no thought remains to one of them.","Then, at dawn, it is as though the blast of Israfils trumpet brings life to the atoms of their bodies, and the thoughts of each one, like scrolls from the next world, fly headlong towards each person without any mistake — the tailors thoughts to the tailor, the lawyers thoughts to the lawyer, the blacksmiths thoughts to the blacksmith, the oppressors thoughts to the oppressor, the thoughts of the just to the just.","Does anyone sleep through the night as a tailor, and rise by day a cobbler?","No, for that work belongs to them, and so they take up their occupation as before.","From this you can see that the likeness of each person continues in the other world.","This makes sense, because in this world we see the same thing.","If we continue with comparison until we reach the end of this thread, we will witness all the states of the next world in this world.","We will sniff out in this world all the circumstances as they correspond to the other world, and we will see that all things are contained in Gods omnipotence.","Many are the bones moldering in their graves, yet enjoying the sweet repose and drunken sleep of that enjoyment and intoxication.","These are not idle words, for the saying goes, May the dust lie sweet on them!","If the dust had no awareness of sweetness, why would anyone say such a thing?","I pray that moon-faced idol May live a hundred years.","My faithful heart a quiver For the shafts of her tears.","In the dust of her door my heart So happy, happy died, Praying, Lord, may her dust Forever happily abide!"," A couple are sleeping on one mattress.","The woman sees herself in the midst of a banquet, a rose-garden and Paradise, the man sees himself in the midst of snakes, the guardians of Hell, and scorpions.","If you investigate, you will see neither Paradise nor Hell.","Why then should it be a surprise that the parts of some, even in the tomb, experience pleasure, repose and intoxication, while some are in pain, forment and agony, yet you can see neither pleasure nor pain?","Therefore, the invisible becomes sensible through the use of comparison.","Comparison is one thing, equivalence is another.","The Gnostics give the name spring to relaxation, happiness and expansion.","They call contraction and sorrow autumn.","What real resemblance is there between happiness and spring, sorrow and autumn?","Yet without this comparison the intellect cannot conceive and grasp the meaning.","So the Koran declares: Not equal are the blind and those with sight, The shadows and the light, The shade and the forrid heat.","Here, faith is compared to light and unbelief to shadows, but faith could be related to a delightful shade and unbelief to a burning, merciless sun boiling the brain.","What resemblance is there between the bright subtlety of faith and the light of this world, or between the sordid gloom of unbelief and the darkness we know at night?","Do you see this man who has fallen asleep while we were talking?","That slumber is not a sign of heedlessness, but safety and security.","Like a caravan travelling along a difficult and dangerous road on a dark night, they drive on in fear, lest harm should befall them.","But as soon as the voice of a dog, or cock, reaches their ears and they find a village, they are carefree.","They stretch out their legs and sleep sweetly.","On the road, where not a sound or murmur would disturb them, they cannot sleep out of fear.","But in the village they find security, and with all the barking of dogs and crowing of cocks, still they are happy and fall asleep.","Our words also derive from community and security, they are the sayings of prophets and saints.","When soul hears the words of those familiar friends, it feels secure and is delivered from any fear, for upon these words is wafted a scent of hope and felicity.","Just as those travelers on that dark night think that every moment thieves are mingling with their caravan, so they desire to hear the words of their fellow travelers and to recognize them by their words.","Once they hear their friends speak they feel secure.","The same is true with you.","Because your essence is subtle, glances are not enough for us, but if you speak we will then hear that familiar friend of our spirits and feel secure and at peace.","So speak!","A certain mouse inhabiting a cornfield is invisible, being so small, but once it makes a sound, then people know it by means of its sound.","And so, people are utterly immersed in the cornfield of this world, and your essence, being extremely subtle, is invisible.","So speak, that they may recognize you.","When we long to see a certain place, our heart goes first to experience the conditions there.","Then our heart returns and draws our body along.","Now all the men and women of this world are like bodies in relation to the saints and the prophets, who are the heart of this world.","These beings of the heart first journeyed to the other world, leaving their human attributes of flesh and skin.","They surveyed the depths and heights of that world, and traversed all the stages, until they knew the way.","Then they came back and summoned mankind, saying, Come to that original world!","For this world is a bleak and empty ruin compared to that garden we have discovered.","From this you should realize that the heart is always attached to its beloved, and has no need to traverse the stages, no need to fear highwaymen, no need of the mules packsaddle.","It is the wretched body that is tied to these things.","I said to my heart, How is it you are barred from the service Of He whose name von bless?"," My heart replied, You misread the signs.","I am constantly in His service, You are the one astray.","Wherever you are, no matter what may happen, always strive to be a lover, a passionate lover.","Once love has become your property you will be a lover eternally, in the grave, at the resurrection, or in Paradise, for ever and ever.","When you have sown wheat, wheat will surely grow, stocks of wheat will fill the shed, loaves of wheat will fill the oven.","When Majnun wanted to write a letter to Laila, he took a pen in his hand and wrote: Your name is on my tongue, Your image is within my sight, Your memory fills my heart, Where, then, can I write?","Your image dwells in my sight, Your name never leaves my tongue.","Your memory occupies the depths of my soul, so where am I to write, seeing that Y ou are here in all these places?","The pen broke, and the page was forn.","Many are those whose heart is full of such reality, but they cannot express the words in terms of speech.","This is not surprising, and is no limit to that love.","On the contrary, the root of the matter is the heart, yearning, and passion.","A child is in love with milk, and from milk it derives succor and strength, yet the child cannot explain milk or describe it, saying, What pleasure I find in drinking milk, and how weak and anguished I would be without it.","The child has no words for it, yet still it desires milk.","Most grown people, on the other hand, even though they might describe milk in a thousand ways, still they find no such pleasure or delight in milk like they did as children.","Rumi asked: What is the name of that youth?","Someone said: Saif al-Din (Sword of the Faith).","Rumi said: No one can judge a sword while it is still in its scabbard.","Truly, the Sword of the Faith is one who defends the way, dedicates their efforts wholly to God, who reveals rightness from error and distinguishes truth from falsehood.","But first they correct themselves and improve their own character: Begin with yourself, said the Prophet.","So they direct all discipline first to themselves, saying, After all, I too am human.","I have hands and feet, ears and understanding, eyes and a mouth.","The prophets and saints — who attained Gods favor and reached their goal — they were human like me with reason, a tongue, hands and feet.","Why were they shown the way?","Why is this door that was opened to them, closed to me?","Such a person corrects themselves night and day, and struggles, saying, What did I do, that I have not been accepted?","They continue until they become the Sword of God and the Tongue of Truth.","For example, ten people want to enter a house.","Nine find the way, but one remains outside and is not allowed in.","Certainly this person reflects inwardly and laments, saying, What did I do that they would keep me out?","What bad manners am I guilty of?","That person attributes the fault to themself and recognizes their own errors and lack of manners.","They should never say, God has done this to me, what can I do?","It is Gods will.","If God willed it, I would be shown the way.","Such words are tantamount to abusing God and drawing the sword against God.","Such a person would be a Sword Against God, not the Sword of God.","God is far beyond having family or friends.","He has not begotten, and has not been begotten, says the Koran.","You cannot say that those who have found the way to God were more Gods kin, more His friends or more closely connected to Him.","No one has ever approached God except from below.","God is all sufficient, You are the needy ones.","Nearness to God is never attained, except through devotion and submission.","He is the Giver of givers.","He fills the skirt of the sea with pearls, He clothes the thorn in the raiment of the rose, He bestows life and spirit upon a handful of dust, all without precedent, all without favorites.","All the world receives their share from Him.","When people hear about a generous person who bestows valuable gifts and favors, naturally they want to visit such a giver of wealth, in hopes of receiving a share of that bounty.","Since Gods Grace is so well known to the entire world, why dont you beg of Him?","Why dont you ask Him for robes of honor, or a rich gift?","Instead, you sit in indolence saying, If He wants to He will give to me.","So you never ask Him for anything.","A dog, without reason or comprehension, when hungry, comes up to you and wags its tail as if to say, Give me food.","I am hungry by the sight of that food you have.","Please give me some.","A dog knows that much.","Are you less than a dog?","The dog is not content to sleep in ashes and say, If he wants to he will throw me some food, but begs and wags its tail.","So should you wag your tail and beg of God, for in the presence of such a Giver, to ask is the expression of a wonderful desire.","If you lack good fortune, ask from One who is not stingy, and a commander of great wealth.","God is always near to you.","Every thought and idea you conceive, there is God — for God gave being to that idea and thought.","Yet God is so close you cannot see It.","What is so strange in that?","In every act you perform, reason guides you and initiates your action, but you cannot see your reason.","You see its effect, but you cannot see its essence.","For instance someone goes to the baths.","Wherever they go within the baths, they feel the heat of the fire, even though they do not see the fire itself.","When they leave the baths, then they see the actual fire and flames.","From this they know that the heat of the baths comes from a fire.","The human being is also a huge bath, and within itself dwells the heat of reason, spirit and the lower self.","But once you leave this bath and enter the other world, you see the actual essences.","Then you know that intelligence comes through the glow of reason, that fallacies and pretenses radiate from the lower self, and the impulse of life itself is the result of spirit.","Y ou can clearly see the essences of all three, but as long as you are in the bath they are invisible.","You can only experience their effect.","When we were in Samarkand, the Khvarizmshah laid siege to Samarkand and attacked with his army.","Not far from us lived an exceedingly beautiful girl, so lovely that none could match her in all the city.","I heard her saying, O God, I know Y ou would never allow me to be delivered into the hands of evildoers.","I know You would never permit that.","I rely on You, O God.","When the city was sacked and all its inhabitants were taken into captivity, even the maidservants of that woman were captured.","But she was left unharmed.","For all her extreme beauty, no man even cast eyes on her.","From this, know that whoever commits themselves to God is secure from harm and remains in safety.","No petition of man in Gods presence is ever ignored.","Therefore beg of God, and demand what you need of God, for your petition will not be in vain.","Call upon Me and I will answer you.","A certain dervish taught his son that no matter what he needed, Ask it of God.","The years passed.","Then one day, while the child was alone in the house, he became hungry.","In his usual way he said, I want some food, I am hungry.","Suddenly a bowl of pottage materialized, and the child ate until he was full.","When his father and mother returned, they said, Arent you hungry?","The child answered, I just asked for food and ate.","His father said, Praise be to God, that your confidence and reliance upon God has grown so strong!","When Mary was bom, her mother vowed to dedicate Mary to the House of God and not to support her.","She left Mary in the Temple.","Zachariah demanded to care for the child, but everyone wanted to do so, as well.","A dispute sprang up amongst them.","Now in that time the custom was that each party in a dispute must throw a stick into water — the one whose stick floated longest was deemed to prevail.","It so happened that Zachariahs stick was the right one.","They all agreed that he had the right to care for Mary.","So every day Zachariah brought food to the child, but he always found an exact match of that food already at her side.","He said, Mary, I am in charge of you.","Where is this food coming from?","Mary said, Whenever I feel the need for food, I ask God and He sends it to me.","His bounty and compassion are infinite.","Whoever relies on Him, their trust is not in vain.","Now, after Zachariah saw this he prayed, O God, since You allow the need of this child, please grant me my desire.","Give me a son who will be Your friend, who, without my prompting, will walk with You and be occupied in obedience to You.","God brought John into being, even though his father was bent and feeble, and his mother was very old and had not borne a single child while she was young.","Still, she became pregnant and gave birth.","Dont you see that all these things are but an occasion for the display of Gods omnipotence?","Everything came from Him, and His will must always come to pass.","The believer knows that behind this wall there is Someone who is aware of every circumstance in our lives, one by one, and who sees us though we do not see Him.","But those who say, No, this is all a tale, they cannot believe.","The day will come when they will realize their error.","For instance, you are playing the rebec.","Even if you can not see anyone, if you know people are behind this wall listening, you will continue playing, for you are a rebec player.","After all, the purpose of prayer is not standing, bowing and prostrating all day, for those moments of spiritual union that possess you in prayer should always be with you.","Whether asleep or awake, writing or reading, in any moment, you should not be far from the remembrance of God.","Speaking and keeping silent, sleeping and eating, being enraged and forgiving — all these attributes should be like the turning of a water mill.","Surely the mill revolves because of water, and it knows this, since it has tried to move without water.","Any mill that believes it is the source of its own turning is the epitome of foolishness and ignorance.","Now this revolving occurs within a narrow space, for that is the nature of this material world.","Therefore, say to God, O God, grant me another turning that is spiritual, since all needs are fulfilled by You.","Therefore bring your needs to Him constantly, and never be without His remembrance, for the remembrance of God is strength, feathers and wings to a bird of spirit.","Through remembrance of God, little by little the inward heart becomes illumined and detached from the outward world.","Just as a bird that tries flying to heaven, even though it never reaches that goal, yet every moment it rises farther from the earth and outsoars the other birds.","Or for instance, some musk is in a jar, but the mouth of that jar is too small, and when you reach in you cannot remove the musk.","Still, your hand is perfumed and your nostrils are fulfilled.","So it is with the remembrance of God: although in this moment you do not attain the Essence of God, still it leaves its mark on you, and you gain the great benefits that go with that mark.","Sheikh Ibrahim is a noble dervish.","When we see him, we are reminded of our beloved friends.","Our Master Shams used to refer to him as our Sheikh Ibrahim, showing his affection.","Divine favor is one thing, but personal effort is another.","The prophets did not attain prophethood through personal effort — they gained that fortune through Divine grace.","Yet God still required the prophets to live a life of personal effort and virtue.","This was for the sake of the common people, so they could put reliance on the prophets and their words.","The gaze of ordinary people cannot penetrate into the inward heart — they see only the outward show.","Yet, following those externals, through the Divine blessings bestowed on those forms, people find the way to the internal.","After all, even Pharaoh made personal efforts of charity and noble acts, but since Gods favor was not present, his generosity and beneficence remained hidden.","Like a military commander who is in charge of a fortress, even when he is kind and generous to the people, if his plan is to throw off allegiance to the king and become a rebel, his kindnesses lose all their worth and luster.","Nevertheless, we should not entirely deny Gods favor to Pharaoh.","Gods grace might have been secret, causing Pharaoh to be rejected for a good purpose.","For a king is both vengeful and gracious.","Fie bestows both robes of honor and prison terms.","The Sufis do not deny Gods favor to Pharaoh completely.","The literalists, however, consider Pharaoh wholly rejected, and this is fine for the proper maintenance of the external teaching.","When a king puts a man on the gallows, he hangs him up high in the presence of the assembled people.","He could also suspend him indoors, hidden from everyone, by a low nail, but it is necessary for the people to see and take warning.","The execution of the kings decrees, and the carrying out of his orders should be visible.","But not every gallows consists of wood.","High rank and worldly fortune are also a gallows, and a very high one.","When God desires to chastise someone, He grants them high rank in the world and a great kingdom, like Pharaoh, Nimrod and the rest.","All those eminent positions are like the gallows from which God hangs people for others to gaze upon and understand.","For God declares, I was a hidden treasure, and I desired to be known.","This is to say, I created all the world to manifest My Reality, now through graciousness, now through severity.","God is not the kind of king for whom one voice is sufficient.","If every atom in the world became Gods herald, they would still be unable to properly proclaim His Truth.","Therefore, day and night people are forever revealing God, but while some understand this, others are unaware.","In either case, the manifestation of Gods will is certain.","For example, a prince orders a man to be beaten, and the man screams and shouts with pain.","Still, everyone sees that both beater and beaten are revealing the princes authority.","Whoever acknowledges God is revealing God continually, and whoever denies God is also revealing God.","For how can anything be demonstrated without its opposites?","Besides, it would be wholly without pleasure and enjoyment.","Thus, someone who loves controversy proposes a motion at a meeting, but if there is no reaction or argument, what can he say in return, and what joy is there in that?","For a proclamation is only meaningful in the face of its own negation.","In the same way, this world is a declaration of God.","Without a proposer and an opposer this declaration would seem pale and lifeless.","The believers are like a single soul.","Dervishes are joined as if by a single body.","If one member feels pain, all the others are distressed.","An eye gives up its seeing, the ear its hearing, the tongue its speech — all meet in that one body.","True friendship is to sacrifice oneself for ones friend.","To plunge into danger for our friends sake.","For all are headed towards one and the same goal.","All are drowned in one and the same sea.","This is the effect of faith, and submission to God.","What is the load they carry with their bodies compared to that load they carry with their souls?","Once the believer surrenders to God, why should they give a thought to distress and danger, to hands and feet?","If their journey is to God, what use do they have for limbs?","God gave you hands and feet to travel in this world, but when travelling to that One who makes hands and feet, what does it matter if you trip and stumble, or like Pharaohs sorcerers go crawling on your belly?","What cause for grief is that?","Poison is good to sup When the fair one fills the cup.","Bitter words are sweet to hear When the speaker is most dear.","Full of pleasure is my love With that salty wit I know of.","Very pleasing is its smart Rubbed into my wounded heart.","And God knows best.","God wills both good and evil, but only blesses the good.","His Law both commands and prohibits, but commandment is only valid when it is opposed to natural desires.","If someone says, Hungry one, eat sweetness and sugar, that is not commandment, but a benefaction.","Prohibition works in the same way.","No one says, Dont eat stones, dont eat thorns, because there is no need to prohibit when there is no desire.","Therefore, for commandments and prohibition against evil to do any good, people must desire evil.","And to will the existence of people who desire evil, is to will evil.","But God does not approve of evil, otherwise He would not have commanded the good.","This is like those who like to teach — they hope their pupils are ignorant, for they cannot teach unless their pupils need to learn.","To desire a thing is to desire the need for that thing.","But no teacher approves of their students ignorance, or why would they teach?","It is the same with doctors: they want illness to exist, since they could not display their medical skill unless people were sick.","But they do not approve of illness, otherwise they would never treat it.","Similarly, bakers want people to be hungry so they can ply their trade and earn a living, but they do not approve of hunger, otherwise they would not sell bread.","This is why commanders and cavalry want their king to have an opponent and an enemy.","How else can they show their bravery and love for the king?","The king would never muster them, having no need.","But they do not approve of the kings enemy, or they would not fight.","Therefore, we should respect the evil desires within ourselves, because God loves those who are grateful and obedient to His Law, and this means nothing without the existence of those desires within us.","Yet, we should not approve of those evil tendencies, but struggle hard to overcome their influence.","Hence, we can see that God wills evil in one respect, but does not will it in another.","Our opponents say, God does not will evil in any way whatever.","That is impossible.","How could He will a thing and not will the need for that thing?","Amongst the needs that God has created is this headstrong nature in humanity that longs to believe such foolishness as what our opponents say, thus leading people away from truth.","The lessons needed by such people are all the evils that exist in this material world.","Did God not will those evils?","However, if God had approved those evils, He would not have issued commandments and prohibitions against them.","This proves that evil is willed for the sake of something greater.","But they still say, God wills only good, and amongst such good things is abstaining from evil.","Therefore, God desires only the averting of evil.","But evil cannot be averted unless evil exists.","Or they say, God wills only faith, but faith cannot exist except after disbelief, so disbelief is a prerequisite to faith.","Therefore, willing evil is only bad when it is willed for its own sake.","When evil is willed for the sake of some good, then it is good.","In the Koran it says, In retaliation there is life for you.","Now, obviously retaliation is evil, being an attack against Gods creation.","But this is a partial evil, while guarding people from the need for future killing is a complete good.","To create a partial evil for the good of all is not wrong, but to partially abandon Gods will while allowing evil to succeed, is wrong indeed.","This is like the mother who does not want to scold her child because of the partial evil in punishment, but the father knows he must punish to avert that evil from taking control, and to nip the trouble in the bud.","God is All-pardoning, All-forgiving and Terrible in retribution.","Does He will that all these names should be true of Him?","The answer must be yes, because He cannot be All-pardoning and All-forgiving without the existence of sin.","Thus, He commands us to be forgiving and to make peace, but this commandment has no meaning without the existence of anger and war.","This is similar to Sadr al-Islams statement that we are commanded to earn and acquire wealth, because in the Koran it says, And expend in the way of God.","Since it is impossible to spend money unless one has money, then this is also a commandment to acquire money.","It is the same when a man calls out, Arise and pray.","This is a charge to perform the ritual cleaning with water, and all the functions that precede prayer as well.","When God loves people He afflicts them.","If they endure with fortitude, He chooses them.","If they are grateful.","He elects them.","Some men and women are grateful to God for His wrathfulness and some for His graciousness.","Both are good, for gratitude is the antidote for all occasions, changing wrath into grace.","The wise and complete servant is grateful for harsh treatment, both publicly and in private, for with the voice of gratitude comes the inspiration to give more.","Even if God sends them to the lowest reaches of Hell, through gratitude Gods purpose is advanced.","Outward complaining is a reflection of inward complaining to God.","Mohammed said, I laugh as I slay.","That means, My laughter in the face of attackers slays their anger and hatred.","Laughter, here, is gratitude in place of complaining.","It is related that a certain Jew lived next door to one of the Companions.","This Jew lived in an upper room, from which all kinds of dirt and filth, the piddle of his children, the water his clothes were washed in, fell into the Muslims apartment below.","Yet the Muslim always thanked the Jew, and instructed his family to do the same.","For eight years this continued, until the Muslim died.","Then the Jew, while visiting the Muslims apartment, to condole with the family, saw all the filth and how it came from his upper room.","He realized what had happened during the past years, and was filled with sorrow.","He said to the Muslims household, Why on earth didnt you tell me?","Why did you always thank me?","They replied, Our father told us to always be grateful, and chided us if we ever gave up being grateful.","So the Jew became a believer.","Examples of virtuous women and men Encourage the development of virtues within, Like the melodious minstrels rhyme Inspires the passing of wine.","For this reason, God, who is All-powerful and All-forgiving, thanked His prophets and servants for what they did for Him.","Now, gratitude for milk to drink is a blessing, but gratitude for those who suck the breast is a Divine blessing.","Although the breast is full, until you suck it the milk does not flow.","Someone asked: What is it that prevents gratitude?","Rumi answered: Inordinate greed, for no matter how much people have, greed wants more.","Since they get less than what their heart is set upon, they cannot be grateful.","But people are unaware of their own defect, and they cannot see the flaw that taints the coin they offer.","Greed is like eating raw meat — inevitably it makes you sick.","Once we realize we have eaten something rotten, a purge becomes necessary.","God, in His wisdom, makes us suffer through ingratitude to purge and rid us of that corrupt conceit, lest that one sickness becomes a hundred sicknesses.","And we tried them with good things and evil, That gratefully they should return."," That is to say, We planned for people in ways they do not know, such as when they avoid seeing secondary causes as partners with God.","It is for this reason that Abu Yazid said, Lord, I have never associated anything else with You.","And God said, O Abu Yazid, not even on the night of the milk?","You said one night, This milk has done me harm.","It is I who create all harm and benefit.","Abu Yazid had seen the secondary causes as separate from God, so God showed him up as a believer in many causes and said, It is I who harmed you, after the milk and before the milk.","I made that milk so you would sin, and I made that harm as a correction to teach you, like a teachers punishment.","When a teacher says, Dont eat the fruit, if the students eat it, and the teacher beats them on the soles of their feet, it is not right for the pupils to say, We ate the fruit and it hurt our feet.","In the same way, whoever refuses to acknowledge that all things are partners to God, God uses ingratitude to cleanse their spirit from the weeds of believing in many causes.","A little with God is much.","The difference between giving praise and giving thanks is that thanks are given for benefits we receive.","No one says, I give thanks for that per-sons beauty and bravery.","Praise giving is less personal.","Rumi said: A man was leading the prayers, and chanted from the Koran: The Bedouins are stubborn in unbelief and hypocrisy.","By chance a Bedouin chieftain was present.","He gave the chanter a good box on the ears.","During the second genuflection, the leader of the prayers chanted a different quote from the Koran: Some of the Bedouins believe in God and the Last Day.","The Bedouin exclaimed, Ha!","That slap has taught you better manners!","Every moment we receive a slap from the unseen world.","Whatever our plans — one slap and we take another course.","As the saying goes, We have no power of our own, it is all a swallowing up and a vomiting.","The meaning of swallowing is descending into this lower world and becoming a part of it.","The meaning of vomiting is expelling falsehood out of the heart.","For instance, if people eat food that turns sour in their stomach, they vomit it.","If they did not cast out that poison, it would become a part of them.","The disciple dances and serves to find a place in the heart of the sheik.","Anything the disciple does that displeases the sheik is cast forth from the sheiks heart, like the food we eat and then vomit.","Just as bad food would become part of us, unless we rejected it, so that disciples poor conduct in time would become a part of the sheik, unless the sheik cast such actions out of their heart.","Gods love was proclaimed to the world And every heart into confusion was hurled, Those hearts were burned and into ashes turned Then to the indifferent wind their ashes spurned.","In that wind of indifference the atoms of those hearts are dancing and singing.","If they are not, then how do we hear their song, and who is it every moment that tells their tale anew?","And if these hearts do not realize their very life consists in burning up and spuming to the wind, how is it they are so eager to be burned?","As for those hearts burned up in the fire of worldly lusts and turned into ashes, do you hear any sound or see any luster from them?","The poet, Urwa ibn Adhina, wrote, I know well the way God provides our daily bread.","What use is there in running about here and there with no purpose?","Truly, when I forget about money, food, clothing and the desires of lust, my daily portion comes to me.","But when I run after those desires, they only bring me pain and wear me out.","If I sit where I belong, with patience, my needs are fulfilled without pain and distress.","For truly, my daily supply is also seeking me and tugging at me.","When it cannot pull me it comes to me, just as when I cannot attract it I go after it.","The upshot of these words is this: absorb yourself with the World to come so that World will pursue you.","Sitting means to sit detached from this world while being absorbed in the affairs of the world to come.","Those who run for the sake of the other World, they are truly seated.","If they are seated for the sake of the present world, they are running.","The Prophet said, Whoever reduces all their cares to a single care, God fulfills all their other needs.","If someone is plagued by ten cares let them worry only about that care for the other World, and God will untangle those other nine knots without any effort.","The prophets cared nothing about fame and daily bread.","Their only care was Gods approval, and yet they received both daily bread and fame.","Whoever seeks Gods pleasure will become bedfellows with the prophets, in this world and the next.","They are with those whom God has blessed, Prophets, people of the path and heaven s guests."," I sit with those who remember Me.","If God did not sit with them, the yearning for God would never have entered their hearts.","The scent of the rose cannot exist without the rose.","The scent of musk never exists without the musk.","There is no end to these words.","Even if they do end, still they are not like other words.","The night s departed, still, my friend, Our story s not yet at an end.","The night and darkness of this world passes away while the light of these words becomes clearer.","Even though the night of the prophets lives have set, still the light of their discourse has not left, nor ended, nor ever will.","People said about Majnun, He loves Laila, what is so strange in that?","After all, they were children together and went to the same school.","Majnun said, They are fools.","What pretty woman is not desirable?","Is there any man whose heart is not stirred by a lovely woman?","It is love that feeds our heart, just as the sight of mother, father and brother, the pleasure of children, the pleasure of lust — all forms of delight are rooted in love.","Majnun was an example of all lovers, just as in grammar other sentences are quoted.","Feast on sweetmeats or on roast, Drink the wine that you love most.","Whats that savor on your lips?","Water that a dreamer sips!","When tomorrow you arise, And great thirst upon you lies, Little use will be that deep Draught you ve taken while asleep.","The delights of this world are the same as people who eat while asleep.","They chase after worldly needs just as if they were looking for something in a dream.","Even if they find it, once they are awake what good will it do them if they have eaten while asleep?","Y et, still, what they ask for in their sleep they are given, for The present is proportionate to the request.","Someone said: We have studied all aspects of the human condition one by one, and not so much as a single hair-tip of human temperament, or peoples hot and cold nature, has escaped our notice.","Yet, we still have not discovered what aspect of the human being survives death.","Rumi said: If such knowledge were attainable merely by asking others, there would be no need for the effort and the work, and no one would put themselves through such pain and sacrifice to know.","For example, people come to the sea, and see nothing but salt water, sharks and fishes.","They say, Where is this pearl others speak about?","Perhaps there is no pearl.","How can the pearl be gained merely by looking at the sea?","Even if they measured out the sea, cup by cup, a hundred thousand times, they would never find the pearl.","A diver is needed to discover that pearl, and not just any diver, but a diver who is both fortunate and nimble.","Humanitys sciences and arts are like measuring the ocean with a cup.","To find the pearl calls for something else.","There are people gifted with every skill, with wealth and good looks to boot, yet this vital quality is not in them.","There are others who are outwardly a wreck, who have neither good looks nor elegant speech, yet in them is this element that is immortal.","By this element we are ennobled and honored, and become superior to all other creatures.","Leopards, crocodiles, and lions each have their own peculiar skills and abilities, but these qualities will not survive.","When a person discovers the essential element, they attain the secret of their own eternal reality.","The accomplishments of the human race are like jewels on the back of a mirror.","The mirrors face has no jewels, it must be crystal clear.","Whoever has an ugly face eagerly looks for the jewels, since the mirrors face shows every dark secret.","A friend of Joseph returned from a far journey.","Joseph asked, What present have you brought me?","The friend replied, What is there you do not possess?","What could you need?","Since no one exists more handsome than you, I have brought a mirror so that every moment you may gaze in it upon your own face.","What is there that God does not possess?","What does He need?","Therefore, bring before God a heart, crystal clear, so that He may see His own perfection.","God looks not at your form, nor at your deeds, but at your heart.","You find a city with everything you desire, beautiful people, pleasures, all that people crave, and ornaments of every kind, but you find not one generous person.","The opposite would be better than this!","That city is the human being.","If in us are a hundred thousand talents, but not that essential element, better if that city were in ruins.","But when that vital quality is there, the outward display matters not — our secret heart will be well furnished.","In every state our heart is with God, and our outward work does not hinder our inward occupation.","In the same way, whether a pregnant woman finds herself at peace or war, sleeping or eating, the child in her womb is still nourished and continues to grow.","The human being is also carrying that secret.","We offered the Trust to the heavens, The earth and the mountains, But they refused to carry it, and were afraid; Yet humanity carried it.","Surely they are sinful, And very foolish.","But God does not leave us in sin and foolishness.","Out of our physical life comes companionship, families, and a thousand familiar friendships.","If this Trust that humanity carries also produces friendships and knowledge, what is so strange in that?","What rises from a person after death?","Look in their secret heart.","Their secret heart is like the root of a tree — although hidden, its influence appears in the leaves and branches.","If a branch or two is broken when the root is whole, they will grow again, but if the root is damaged, neither bough nor leaf remains.","A farmer from the country came to visit and stay in the house of a friend in town.","The towns person offered their friend halvah, which the guest ate with gusto.","The farmer said, O friend, night and day I eat carrots.","Now that I have tasted halvah, the pleasure of eating carrots has disappeared.","But where I live I can not find halvah every day.","What am I to do?","Once a farmer has tasted halvah, they yearn for the place where it is made.","The towns person has carried their heart away.","What can they do?","They come looking for their heart.","Some people, when they greet you, the smell of smoke comes from their greeting.","Some, when they speak, the smell of musk lingers on.","Only those with a sensitive nose know the difference.","We must test our friends, so that in the end we have no cause for regret.","Here is another of Gods rules: Begin with yourself.","If you claim to be humble and serve God, do not accept this claim without testing it.","When people wash, first they lift some water to their nose and then they taste it.","Simply looking at the water is not enough, for water may have the appearance of purity, but its taste and smell will prove if it is infected.","Once the test is done, then they wash their faces.","Whatever you keep hidden in your heart, God manifests in you outwardly.","Whatever the root of the tree feeds on in secret, affects the bough and the leaf.","Their mark is on their faces.","The Koran also says: We shall brand them upon the muzzle!","If you want no one to see into your thoughts, then how will you hide the flush of color on your face?","Rumi said: Until you see, how can you find?","This is true for all but Lovers: For how can they seek the Beloved, Being blind, Until they have discovered?","The human quest consists of seeking for what has not yet been found.","Night and day people are searching for that.","But the quest that begins after our desire has been found and attained, that is a strange quest indeed, beyond our imagination and comprehension.","The worldly quest is searching for something new, something not yet experienced, but this other quest begins with what we have already found and then desire.","This is Gods quest, for God is the Finder.","O friend, so long as you thirst for what is created in time, you are far from your goal.","But, once your quest passes away into Gods quest and Its Quest overrides your own, then you have been found.","Then you can truly seek.","A student said: There is no way to prove who is a friend of God and who has attained union with God.","Neither words, nor deeds, nor miracles, nor anything else can offer proof.","For words can be mimicked, with practice.","As for deeds and miracles, there are those who can read a persons inmost thoughts, and display many wonders through magic.","Rumi asked: Do you believe in anyone or not?","The student answered: Yes, by God.","I both believe and love.","Rumi said: Is this belief of yours, in that person, founded on proof and token?","Or did you simply shut your eyes and take up that person?","The student said: God forbid that my belief should be without proof and token.","Rumi said: Then why do you say there is no proof or token leading to belief?","You have contradicted yourself.","Another person said: Every saint and great mystic has said, I enjoy a nearness with God and Divine favor that no one else has known before.","Rumi answered: Who made this statement — a saint, or someone else?","If it was a saint, then they knew that every saint has had this belief, so how could a saint believe they are the only recipient of Divine favor?","However, if someone other than a saint made this statement, then in truth that one is the friend and elect of God, for God has kept this experience from all the saints but has not hidden it from that one.","The same person tried to support their statement with a parable: Once there was a king with ten concubines.","The concubines said, We want to know which of us is dearest to the king.","The king declared, Tomorrow this ring shall be in the room of whomever I love best.","Next day the king commanded ten rings to be made identical with that ring, and gave one ring to each maiden.","Rumi said: The question still stands.","This story provides no answer, and changes nothing.","The statement, The king loves me best, was made by one of the ten maidens, or by someone else.","If one of the ten maidens made this statement, and she knew that each of the maidens had been given a ring just like hers, then how could she feel that she was loved best?","However, if this statement was made by someone other than those ten maidens, then that person was truly shown the kings favor and special love.","Someone said: A true lover must be submissive and abject and longsuffering.","And they listed other qualities.","Rumi said: Should the lover be like that whether the beloved wishes it or not?","If the lover is this way against the desire of the beloved, then they are no lover but merely following their own desire.","If the lover accepts the desire of the beloved, then when their beloved does not want them to be submissive and abject, how could they be submissive and abject?","Therefore, the states affecting the lover are unknown, and we can only know how the beloved wishes us to be.","Jesus said, I wonder at the living creature that can eat a living creature.","The literalists say that this refers to people eating the flesh of animals.","This is an error.","Why?","Because when people eat flesh, it is not animal any longer, but inanimate.","Once the animal is killed, the living spirit is gone from that flesh.","The true meaning of this saying is that the Sheikh mysteriously consumes the disciple.","I wonder at a process so extraordinary!","Someone asked the following question: Abraham said to Nimrod, My God brings the dead to life and turns the living into the dead.","Nimrod said, When I banish people, it is the same as causing them to die, and when I appoint someone to a post it is as if I brought them to life.","Then Abraham gave up this argument, being compelled to yield to Nimrods point.","He then embarked on another line of reasoning, saying, My God brings the sun up from the east and sends it down in the west.","Do the opposite of that!"," Isnt this argument at odds with the other?","Rumi answered: God forbid that Abraham could have been silenced by Nimrod and left without any answer!","The truth is that Abraham used his second statement to show how God brings life out of the womb of the east, and sends it back to death in the tomb of the west.","Abrahams argument was presented with perfect consistency.","God creates us anew every moment, bringing something perfectly fresh into our inner heart.","Gods first moment is nothing like His second, neither is His second moment like the third.","Yet people, being unconscious of themselves, do not see this birth and death.","Sultan Mahmud was given a fine horse, with an exquisite shape.","Next festival day he rode that horse, and all the people sat on their rooftops to see him and enjoy the spectacle.","But one drunken fellow wouldnt move from his apartment.","By force, they carried him up to the roof, saying, Come and look at the Sultans horse!","He said, I am busy with my own affairs.","I dont want to see it.","But he could not escape.","So he sat there on the edge of the roof, extremely drunk, as the Sultan passed by.","When the drunken fellow saw the Sultan on the horse he cried out, What do I care about this horse?","Why, this very moment if that horse were mine and a minstrel sang even one song, I would give it to him.","Hearing this, the Sultan became extremely angry and had the man thrown into prison.","A week passed.","Then the man sent a message to the Sultan, saying, What is my crime?","What sin did I commit?","Let the King of the World state the case so his servant can be informed.","The Sultan ordered the man to be brought into his presence.","He said, You insolent rogue, how could you utter such words?","How dare you speak so rudely?","The man answered, King of the World, it was not I who spoke those words.","In that moment a drunken manikin was sitting on the edge of the roof and spoke those words.","This hour I am not that fellow.","I am an intelligent and sensible man.","The Sultan was delighted by his answer and conferred on him a robe of honor and ordered his release.","Whoever joins us and becomes drunk on this wine, no matter where they go, or whoever they visit, in reality their moments are still spent with us.","For the coolness of strangers reminds us of our own friends gracious company, and mingling with those who do not know this wine stimulates love and desire for those who do.","This is why people prize other fruits above sugar, saying, We have tasted so much bitterness that we attained the rank of sweetness.","How can you know the delight of sweetness until you have suffered the bitter?","Rumi was asked the meaning of the following lines: When love attains its ultimate goal Desire turns to dislike.","Rumi explained: Dislike is a narrow world compared to friendship.","That is why people run from hatred to find friendship.","But the world of friendship is itself narrow next to the Source of both friendship and dislike.","Friendship and enmity, unbelief and faith — these are all opposites that lead to duality.","Yet a world exists where there is no duality but only pure unity, and when we reach that world we are beyond friendship and dislike.","There is no room for two in that world.","When we arrive there, we leave duality behind.","The world of freedom we loved and struggled for is narrow next to that state where no opposites exist.","Therefore, we no longer desire it, and are repulsed by it.","When Mansur al-Hallaj reached his utmost friendship with God, he became his own enemy and gave away his life.","He said, I am God, meaning, I have passed away.","God alone remains.","This is extreme humility.","Your saying, Thou art God, and I am Your servant, is arrogance, for you have affirmed your own existence, and created dualism.","To say, He is God, is still duality, for until I exists He is impossible.","Therefore it was God alone who said, I am God, since Mansur had passed away.","The world of imagination is greater than facts and concepts, for all concepts are bom of imagination.","Yet imagination itself is narrow compared to that world from which imagination is born.","This is the limit of explanations, for that reality cannot be made known by words and expressions.","Someone asked: Then what is the use of expressions and words?","Rumi answered: Words set you searching.","They are not the objects of your quest.","If that were the case, there would be no need for all this spiritual struggle and self-sacrifice.","Words are like glimpsing something far away.","You follow in its trail to see it better, but this doesnt mean the trail is what you are seeking.","Speech is inwardly the same — it excites you to seek the meaning, even though the words are never the reality.","The other day someone said, I have studied many sciences and mastered many ideas, yet I still do not know what essence in the human being exists forever.","I have searched, but I have not discovered it.","If such things were knowable through words alone, you would never need to pass away from your self and suffer such pains.","But if you did not endure the struggle of losing your temporary self, how could you ever know that essence which will remain?","A boy says, I have heard about the Kaaba, but no matter how far I look I can not see it.","I will go up to the roof and search from there.","When he gets to the roof and stretches out his neck, he still can not see the Kaaba, so he rejects that any Kaaba exists.","To see the Kaaba takes more than that.","It is impossible to see it from the place where one abides.","In the same way, during winter, you hunt for a fur jacket with all your soul, but when summer arrives you fling it away and forget about it.","You sought the coat for the warmth.","You were in love with warmth.","In winter you can not find warmth and therefore need the medium of the coat, but once the summer sun starts to shine, you fling the fur jacket away.","When heaven is rent asunder, and When earth is shaken with a mighty shaking, are references to yourself.","They mean that you have experienced the pleasure of being gathered together, but the day is coming when you will experience the pleasure of being tom apart.","Then you will behold the expanse of the other world and be delivered from this present narrowness.","For instance, if someone is held down by four nails for a long time, they start to feel comfortable with this condition, and forget the pleasure of being free.","After they escape the four nails, then they realize the forment they had been in.","Similarly, children are swaddled and put to rest in a cradle, and they are perfectly at ease with their hands bound.","But if a grown person were cribbed in a cradle, it would be forment and prison.","Some feel pleasure when roses bloom and push forth their heads from the bud.","Some feel pleasure when the petals of the rose become scattered by the wind and rejoin their origin.","Therefore, some people want friendship, passion, unbelief and faith all to dissolve and return to their source.","For these are walls of form cause narrowness and duality, while the other world is broadness and absolute unity.","These words of themselves have no power.","How can they be powerful?","They are merely words.","In fact, in themselves they can become a cause of weakness.","Yet they inspire some to truth.","Words are a veil.","How can two or three letters combined together cause life and excitement?","When people come to visit and you greet them politely, and welcome them, they are happy and feel affection, if you receive them with two or three words of abuse, those two or three words cause them anger and pain.","Now what connection is there between stringing together a few words and an increase in affection, or provocation of anger?","God appointed these veils so that no ones gaze can fall upon Its beauty and perfection.","Weak veils are appropriate to weak eyes.","Bread in reality is not the cause of life, but God has made it appear to be the cause of life and strength.","After all, bread has no human life of itself, so how can it create strength?","If it had any life at all, it would have kept itself alive.","Rumi was asked the meaning of the following lines from his Masnavi: You are that very thought, my brother: Those bones and nerves are something other.","Rumi said: You should think about this.","That very thought in reality is not thought at all, and if it is, it does not belong to the kind of thought that people usually mean by the term.","In using the word thought my intention was the idea or essential element.","If you need to put this idea into a more humdrum way so that common people can understand, then say: The human being is a speaking animal.","Speech is thought, whether spoken or not.","The rest of the human being is animal.","Therefore, it is perfectly true to say people consist of thought, and the rest is bones and nerves.","Speech is like the sun, all people derive warmth and life from the sun, and the sun is always there.","The entire world is warmed by the sun, yet the suns rays are not always visible.","When thought is expressed through word or sign, be it thanks or complaint, good or evil, then the sun of speech becomes visible, just as the rays of the celestial sun become visible when they shine upon a wall.","So, the rays from that sun of speech only appear through the medium of letters and sounds.","Though always present — for that sun is subtle, and He is the All-subtle — some element of grossness is required for it to become visible and apparent.","A certain man said that God had no meaning for him, the word left him bewildered and frozen.","When they said, This is Gods Creation, these are His Commandments, and these are His Laws, then he felt the warmth of those rays.","So, although Gods subtlety always existed and shone upon that man, until they explained it to him through the medium of Commandment, Creation and Law, he was unable to see.","There are some people, who, due to illness, cannot use honey.","Yet through the medium of some other food, such as mixed into rice dressed with turmeric or halvah, they can eat it.","Once they recover from their illness, however, then they can take honey without any medium.","Therefore, speech is a subtle sun shining continually, without ceasing, and we need some gross medium in order to see and enjoy it.","But, once you can see those rays and that subtlety without any gross medium, then you find wonderful colors and marvelous spectacles in the depths of that sea.","Yet what is so amazing about that?","For speech is always within you, whether you actually speak or not, even if you have no thought of speaking.","Philosophers say, The human being is a speaking animal.","Animality is always within you as long as you are living, just as speech is always within you.","Chewing is one expression of animality, it is not a state of itself.","In the same way, speaking and talking are only reflections of Speech.","People have three spiritual states.","In the first they have no thought of God at all, but worship and pay service to everything else: friends and lovers, wealth and children, stones and clods.","Once they gain a little knowledge and awareness, then they serve nothing but God.","Yet, after learning and seeing more they enter a state of silence.","They do not say, I serve God, nor I do not serve God, for they have transcended both.","No sound issues from these people into the world.","God is neither present nor absent, For God is the Creator of both."," All words, all sciences, all skills, all professions derive their flavor and relish from Speech.","The end of that chapter cannot be known, however, for they are only expressions, and not the state of itself.","This is illustrated by the man, who in seeking the hand of a wealthy and beautiful woman, looks after her sheep and horses, and waters her orchards.","Though his time is occupied with those services, their flavor derives from the woman.","If the woman were to disappear, those tasks would become cold and lifeless.","In this same way, all professions and sciences derive life, pleasure and warmth from the rays of the Saints inspiration.","But for their inspiration, all tasks would be utterly without relish and enjoyment.","Rumi said: When I first began composing poetry, a great urge compelled me.","At that time the urge was strong.","Now the desire has grown weaker and is declining, but still it has its effect.","Such is the way of God.","He gives life to things in the time of their rising, producing great results and wisdom, yet in declining His influence still has its force.","The Lord of the East and the West, means, He fosters both the rising and declining.","The Mutazilites believe that people create their own acts; that every deed springs out of our own creation.","But this cannot be true, for everything that we do is produced through our mind, spirit, senses or body.","Yet, we havent created any of these instruments.","Since we are not the creator and are not capable of creating such things, then these functions cannot be fully subject to our control.","And it is impossible for us to create an act without these instruments.","Therefore, we realize that the true creator of our actions is not our own selves, but God.","We perform every effort of ours, whether good or evil, according to our own plans and purpose, but the wisdom of that deed is not limited to our intentions.","We are only able to see that portion of the wisdom and benefits that derive from our actions.","God, however, knows the total advantage of that deed, and what fruits it will bear.","For instance, you pray to gain rewards in the next world and to acquire a good name and safety in the present.","But the help derived from prayer is not limited to that — it also bestows a hundred thousand advantages you will never understand.","Only God, who gives rise to your prayer, knows those advantages.","We are like a bow in the grip of Gods hand.","God sends us out upon various tasks.","In reality God is the agent, not the bow.","The bow is merely an instrument, unaware and unconscious of God, so that the worlds apparent order can be maintained.","Mighty indeed is the bow that becomes aware of the Bowmans hand!","What can you say about a world whose perpetuation and order rests on heedlessness?","Dont you see how the people who are awakened become indifferent to this world?","Through childhood, people grow and gain strength from negligence and play.","How else can they ever have grown up to become men and women?","Therefore, God puts us through pains and labors to wash away those acts of negligence and make us clean.","Only then are we able to become aware of the other world.","The human being is like a dunghill, a heap of manure.","If this manure-heap is precious, it is because hidden in it is the seal ring of the King.","You are like a sack of com.","The King cries out, Where are you carrying that com?","My cup is in it.","People are unaware of the cup, being absorbed in the com.","If they knew of the cup, how could the com distract them?","Now, every thought that draws you toward the other world, making you cold and indifferent to this lower world, is a reflection of that cup flashing out.","When men and women yearn after this lower world, however, this is a sign that the cup has become hidden in the heap.","Someone said: Qadi Izz al-Din sends his greetings, and always speaks of you in the most approving terms.","Rumi answered: Whoever remembers us, and speaks us well, Long may the world of their high merit tell.","When people speak well of others, those good words reflect back on themselves, and in the end they are praising and applauding their own essence.","Those who cultivate the habit of speaking well of others are like gardeners who plant flowers and aromatic herbs around their houses — wherever they look out they see a beautiful display and are always in Paradise.","Whenever we speak well of another, that person becomes our friend.","When we remember them, we remember a friend, and thinking of a friend is like being near flowers and aromatic herbs.","It is refreshment and repose.","But when we speak ill of others, those people become repulsive in our eyes.","When we think of them or their image even enters our thoughts, it is the same as snakes or scorpions, thorns or thistles appearing before us.","Since you can have flowers, aromatic herbs and the meadows of Iram, why do you choose to walk among the brambles and thorns?","Think well of everyone so that you always dwell amongst the fields and meadows.","Once you become the enemy of everyone, the images of your foes surround you day and night like scorpions and snakes.","This is why the saints have love for all people and think well of whomever they meet — not for the sake of others, but solely for themselves.","Since, in this world no one can escape talking about other people or encountering their images, the saints struggle to hold everything in their mind and memory in an amiable and positive light, so that hateful images will not block their way.","So, whatever you say of others returns to yourself.","Mohammed said: Whoever does good, it is to their own gain, And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss.","And whoever does an atom s weight of good Shall see it, And whoever does an atom s weight of evil Shall see it."," Someone asked a question about the following quote from the Koran: God declared: 7 am setting in the earth a viceroy."," The angels said: What?","Will You set there one Who does corruption, and sheds blood, While we proclaim Your praise and call You holy?","Since Adam had not yet come into the world, how could the angels know beforehand that the human race would be corrupt and shed blood?","Rumi answered: There are two explanations — one traditional, and the other rational.","The traditional version says that the angels read from the Preserved Tablet that a people would come forth who would act like this.","The rational version says that the angels deduced by reasoning that people would come forth from the earth, and such people would have to bear the qualities of the earth, like animals.","Although the spiritual element would be present in human beings, namely that they could speak, yet since animality would also be in them, they would by necessity be ungodly and shed blood, this being the heritage of being human.","There is still another answer.","Some people say that angels, being pure reason and goodness, have no choice in anything they say or do.","Like in a dream, if you have no choice of what you say or do, how can you be criticized when you utter unbelief in your sleep, or declare God is One, or if you commit adultery?","Angels are like this in their waking state.","People are the reverse of that — they have freewill, are lustful and passionate, desire all things for themselves, and are ready to shed blood to gain what they want.","These are the attributes of animals.","Thus the state of the angels is the opposite of people.","It is perfectly fine to say that the angels spoke in this fashion, even though there was neither speech nor tongue, because if they were endowed with words and gave an account of themselves, this is how they would speak.","In this same way the poet writes, The pool said, I am full.","Pools of course do not really speak, but the poet means that if the pool had a tongue, this is what it would have said.","Every angel has a tablet within them, and from that tablet, according to the degree of their own powers, they can read all that is to happen in the world and everything that will take place.","When the moment arrives and what they have read actually comes into being, then their belief becomes stronger and their love and intoxication increase.","They marvel at Gods majesty and omniscience.","That increase of love and faith, that wordless and unexpressed wonder, is the angels praise of God.","Thus, a builder tells their apprentice, In this house being built, so much wood will be used, so many bricks, so many stones, and so much straw.","When the house is complete and exactly that amount of material was used, neither more nor less, then the faith of the apprentice grows.","The angels too are in a similar case.","Someone asked: The Prophet had such majesty that God said, But for thee I would not have created the heavens, and yet Mohammed said, Would that the Lord of Mohammed had not created Mohammed.","How can this be?","Rumi answered: Let me offer a comparison for this to help you understand the meaning.","In a certain village a man fell in love with a woman.","The two lived together in happiness and pleasure.","They grew fat and thrived on one another.","They lived through each other, just as fish live in water.","Many years they were together.","Then one day God made them wealthy, bestowing on them many sheep, oxen and horses, gold, servants and slaves.","Because of their great fortune and prosperity, they set out for the city.","Each purchased a royal palace, with horses and retinue — she in one part of the city and he in another.","Once they reached their peak of wealth, they were no longer able to enjoy each others company.","Their hearts smoldered away within them, and they uttered secret lamentations, being unable to speak.","The consuming fire in them became so violent that they entirely perished in the flames of separation.","The forture of their grief passed all bounds.","Finally their longing was heard by God.","Their horses and sheep began to vanish, and little by little they were restored to their former condition.","So, after a long while, they were reunited in their home village and resumed full enjoyment of their life together.","When they recalled the bitterness of their separation, they cried, Would that our Lord had never granted us such wealth.","As long as Mohammeds soul was dwelling in the world of holiness and union with God, he grew and thrived, plunging about in that sea of compassion like a fish.","But, in this earthly world, even though he was endowed with the rank of prophet and guide to humanity, and granted greatness, majesty, fame and a large following, still on returning to that former joyous life he said, Would that I never became a prophet or came into this world.","All these sciences, struggles and acts of devotion, in comparison to the merit and majesty of God, mean no more than bowing once, performing a service and then leaving.","Even if you moved the whole Earth with your heart to serving God, it would amount to the same as bowing once to the ground.","For Gods merit and graciousness existed before your life and service.","Did He bring you forth, give you existence, and make you capable of service and worship that you should boast of serving Him?","These services and sciences are just as if you carved little shapes of wood and leather, then came to offer them up to God, saying, I like these little shapes.","I made them, but it is Your job to give them life.","If You give them life, You will make my works live.","Or, You do not have to — the command is entirely Yours.","Abraham said, God is He who gives life and death.","Nimrod said, I give life and death.","When God gave Nimrod kingship, he deemed himself omnipotent as well, not attributing this credit to God.","Nimrod said, I too bring life to some and cause others to die, and what I desire throughout my kingdom comes from my knowledge.","When God bestows knowledge, sagacity and shrewdness, people claim all credit for themselves, saying, Through my skill and abilities, I gave life to these actions and have attained ecstatic joy.","Abraham said, No, it is God who gives life and brings death.","Someone said: Abraham said to Nimrod, My God is He who brings up the sun out of the east and sends it down in the west.","God brings the sun from the east.","If you claim to be a god, then do the reverse.","But then Nimrod compelled Abraham to abandon this point, and Abraham left his first argument and Nimrods rejoinder unanswered, embarking upon another proof.","Rumi answered: Others have talked nonsense about this, and now you too are talking nonsense.","Abraham gave one and the same argument in two different forms.","You have misunderstood, and so did they.","There are many meanings underlying this statement.","One meaning is this; that God brought you out of the concealment of non-exis-tence from your mothers womb.","Your east was your mothers womb.","From there you rose, and you will go down into the west of your tomb.","This is precisely the first statement, only expressed in another way: He gives life and brings death.","Now, if you are able, bring forth life from the west of the tomb, and send it back to the east of the womb.","That is one meaning — here is another: Through obedience, strenuous effort, and noble actions the Gnostic attains illumination and spiritual intoxication, but through the abandonment of obedience and effort their happiness goes down like the sinking sun, therefore these two states are their east and west.","So, if you are able to bring life into a state of death through abandonment of God, corruption and disobedience, then out of this setting sun manifest the illumination that only rises out of obedience.","But that is not the job of the servant, and the servant will never be able to do it.","That is Gods job; for if He wishes He causes the sun to rise from the west, and if He wishes from the east.","The unbeliever and the believer both express the praises of God.","For God has promised that anyone who chooses the right road and practices right action, following the sacred law and the way of the prophets and saints, shall be granted happiness, illumination and life.","If they do the reverse, they will be granted darkness and fear, pits and suffering.","Since both believer and unbeliever choose as they do, and what God has promised comes to pass precisely, neither more nor less, then both are proclaiming the praises of God — the believer with one tongue, and the unbeliever with another.","How great that difference is between the praises of one, and the praises of the other!","For instance, a thief commits a theft and is hung on the gallows.","That thief is a preacher to the world, saying, Whoever commits a theft, this is what becomes of them.","On another person, the king bestows a robe of honor due to their trustworthiness.","They are also a preacher to the world.","But the thief preaches with one tongue, and the trusty servant with another.","Consider the difference between these two preachers!","Rumi said: You are now experiencing happiness.","Why?","Because the mind is a delicate thing, and like a snare it was properly set to catch its prey.","If you are unhappy, then that snare is tom and useless.","Therefore, it is best not to be excessive in love or hatred towards others, since both of these leave the snare broken and tom.","Moderation is best.","By excessive love, I mean love for other than God.","How can love for God ever be excessive?","It is inconceivable — the greater our love for God, the better.","Yet, when our love for someone else becomes excessive, we strive for them to experience only good fortune, but that is impossible, and so the mind becomes disturbed.","Similarly, when enmity is excessive, we wish that person only bad luck and misfortune, but the wheel of heaven is ever turning, and everyones circumstances are also revolving.","One moment they are lucky, the next unlucky, and this seems unfair and disturbing to the mind.","But love for God is latent in all people, Magians, Jews or Christians, and in all things that have being.","How can anyone not love Him who is the source of their existence?","Therefore, love is latent in everyone, but circumstances veil that love.","When those circumstances change, that love becomes manifest.","Yet, why do I speak of only things that have being?","Non-being is also churning in the hope and expectation of being granted existence.","Non-beings are like four people standing before a king, each one hoping the king will grant them special rank, and yet each one ashamed before the other three, because their own desires contradict each other.","So they stand, ranging in their expectation of finding existence through God, yet each desiring to be the first, and therefore embarrassed before one another.","If non-beings are in such a circumstance, how should those in existence be?","There is nothing that does not proclaim His praise."," This is not remarkable.","What is remarkable is that even no-thing proclaims His praise.","Both faith and unbelief are seeking Thee And shouting Thy undivided Unity.","This house is built out of forgetfulness.","All bodies and forms in this world are sustained through forgetfulness.","Even our full-grown bodies grew by forgetting.","But remembrance of God cannot exist without forgetfulness, for something must be forgotten before there can be remembrance.","Therefore, faith and unbelief are one and the same, since one does not exist without the other.","They are indivisible, and God is one.","God is alone and has no partner.","Someone said: Sayed Burhan al-Din discourses very well, yet he quotes Sanai too frequently.","Rumi answered: What you say is true: the sun is excellent, yet it gives light.","Is that a fault?","Using Sanais words casts light on his discourse.","The sun casts light on things, and through that light it is possible to see.","The purpose of light is to see.","After all, this sun in our heaven illuminates things that have no use.","But the real sun shows things that are of use.","This worldly sun is a reflection and a metaphor.","That real sun is the true sun.","Do you yearn for the real sun and seek the light of knowledge?","Then be expectant of understanding and learning something from every teacher and every friend.","We know of that other sun, apart from our physical sun, from which the realities and inner truths are revealed.","Yet this partial knowledge that draws you, and through which you feel pleasure, is but a branch of that great knowledge and a ray of it.","This ray is calling you to the original sun.","Those — they are called from a far place.","You try to draw that knowledge towards yourself, but it answers you, I cannot be contained in your world, it is impossible, and you have stayed away so long because it is difficult to reach me.","Now, what is impossible is impossible, but what is difficult is not impossible.","So, strive to attain that great knowledge, but do not expect to contain it here.","The wealthy ones, out of their love for Gods wealth, collect penny by penny, grain by grain.","But the ray of wealth says, I am calling to you from infinite wealth.","Why do you try drawing me piece by piece?","I cannot be contained in pieces.","Listen, and follow me to unlimited riches.","In short, the beginning depends upon the end — may the end be praiseworthy!","What is a praiseworthy end?","That the tree whose roots are fixed firm in the spiritual garden, whose branches, boughs and fruits suspend over another land, and whose fruits have scattered — that in the end those fruits should be carried back into that garden of its original roots.","But if the roots of a tree belong to this world, although outwardly proclaiming praises of God, all its fruits should be carried back to this world.","And if both roots and fruit are in the spiritual garden, then that is Light upon Light.","Akmal al-Din said: I love our Master and desire to see him.","Even heaven is blotted out of my mind.","I find comfort in his image without the need for any discourses or lofty ideas.","I rest in his beauty.","Pleasure comes to me from his very mien — even from a mental picture of him.","Rumi answered: Although heaven and God do not enter your thoughts, still they are implicit in love.","A beautiful dancing-girl was once playing the castanets in the presence of the Caliph.","The Caliph said, Y our art is in your hands.","She replied, No, in my feet, great Caliph!","Excellence appears in my hands only because they have captured the excellence of my feet.","Although you do not remember heaven in every detail, still your delight in seeing the Sheikh, and your fear of being separated from him, contain all those details.","All of heaven is captured in that image.","A family cherishes and loves each other.","If thoughts of their care and fidelity, compassion and fondness, and all the other benefits that kinsmen look for from kinsmen — if these thoughts do not enter their minds, still all these details are implicit.","In the same way, air is implicit in wood, whether that wood is buried in earth or drenched in water.","Without air in wood, fire could have no effect upon it, for air is the fuel of fire, the life of fire.","Have you not seen how a breath of air puts life into fire?","Whether wood is in water or earth, still air is latent in it.","If air were not latent, wood could never rise to the surface of water.","It is the same with the words you speak.","Many things are contained in those words, such as intelligence and thought, lips and mouth, throat and tongue, as well as the elements and temperaments, the influence of the stars, and the hundred thousand secondary causes upon which the world depends.","On and on you can continue until you come to the world of attributes, and then essence — although none of these realities are put into words, yet all is implicit in your words.","Every day undesirable and painful experiences happen to us without our freewill.","Certainly these things contain implicit messages in them beyond our creation.","We are under the control of Someone beyond, Someone that watches over.","With many, an evil act brings pain.","But despite these unwanted experiences, our nature does not want to accept the thought that we are under the control of another.","Divinity, which is the opposite of servanthood, is given to us on loan.","We can be beaten over the head, still we wont let go of our borrowed stubbornness.","We forget about our unwanted experiences, and we can not hear their message.","Until that borrowed divinity becomes our own, we will not escape from being slapped.","Rumi related: A certain Gnostic once said, I went to the baths to expand my heart, since the baths had become the place of retreat for certain saints.","I saw that the master of the bath stove had an apprentice.","The master was telling the apprentice, Do this and do that.","The apprentice was working briskly, and the stove gave off good heat because of how nimbly the orders were obeyed.","Fine, said the master.","Be nimble like this.","If you are always energetic and mind your manners, I will give you my own position, and appoint you to my own place.","I was overcome with laughter, said the Gnostic, and my inner knot was resolved, for I saw that bosses of this world all behave like this with their apprentices.","Someone said, The astronomers say: Y ou claim there is something beyond the heavens and this terrestrial ball.","We believe, apart from what we see, nothing exists.","If something exists, then show us where it is!","Rumi answered: Your demand is invalid from the very start.","You say, Show me where it is, but that Thing has no place.","Come then, tell me, where is your objection?","Is it on your tongue, in your mouth, or within your breast?","Search through all of these — divide them piece by piece, atom by atom, and you will still not find your objection, nor any thought.","From this we realize that thought has no place.","Since you do not know the place of your own thought, how could you know the place of the Creator of thought?","Thousands of emotions and moods come over you without your choice, for they are completely outside your power and control.","If you only knew where these emotions came from, you would be able to augment them.","All these emotions pass over you, and yet you are wholly unaware where they come from, where they are going, and what they will do.","Since you are incapable of penetrating your own moods, how do you expect to penetrate your Creator?","Those whore sons say, God is not in the heavens.","You cur, how do you know God is not?","Yes, you have measured heaven span by span.","You have gone through all of it, and you pronounce, God is not in the heavens.","Why, you do not know the whore you have in your own home, then how could you know the heavens?","Oh yes, you have heard of heaven, and the names of stars and the spheres.","You think that is something.","If you really penetrated the depths of the heavens, or even mounted one single step, you would never utter such nonsense.","When we say that God is not in the heavens, we do not mean that God is not in the heavens.","We mean that heaven cannot contain God, while God contains all.","God has an ineffable link with the heavens, just as He has established an ineffable link with you.","All things are in the hand of Gods omnipotence, within His creation and under His control.","Therefore God is not outside the heavens and the universe, neither is He wholly in them.","In other words, these things do not comprehend God, and yet God comprehends all.","Someone said: Before earth, heaven and the Throne existed, where did God exist?","One of Rumis students answered, This question is invalid from the start, for God is One who has no place.","Rumi said: You ask, Where was God before all thisHave you discovered the place of all these things in you, that you are searching for His place?","Since your moods and thoughts have no place, how can a place for God be conceivable?","Surely, the Creator of thought is subtler than thought.","For instance, those who build a house are subtler than that house, because they are able to make and plan a hundred other buildings, each different from the last.","Therefore they are subtler and more majestic than any fabric, but this subtlety can only be seen when they build a house and their work enters the visible world.","Your breath is visible in winter, but in summer is invisible.","This doesnt mean that your breath is cut off in summer, but in summer your breath is subtler and can not be seen.","In the same way your attributes and essential elements are too subtle to be seen until you perform some act.","For instance, your clemency exists, but it cannot be seen until you forgive an offender.","Then your clemency becomes visible.","Similarly, your vengefulness cannot be seen, but when you take revenge upon criminals and beat them, then your vengefulness is seen.","Because of Gods extreme subtlety He cannot be seen.","So He created heaven and earth, that His omnipotence and His handiwork would be visible.","These words I am given to share are not in my complete control, and therefore I am pained, because I would like to counsel my friends but the words do not come as I want them to.","This brings pain.","But since these words are higher than I, and I am subject to them, I am happy.","For the words that God speaks bring life wherever they reach, and leave a deep impression.","And when you threw, it was not you who threw, but God."," The arrow that leaps from the bow of God, no shield or breastplate can stop.","Therefore I am happy.","If we knew all that there was to know, and all ignorance was eliminated, we would be consumed and cease to be.","Therefore ignorance is a good thing, since through it this world continues to exist.","Knowledge is also desirable, for it leads to the awareness of God.","Thus, each is a partner with the other, and all opposites are joined.","Night is the opposite of day, yet they are partners and both do the same work.","If night lasted forever, our eyes would become dazzled and our brains would go insane.","Therefore we rest and sleep at night, and the brain, thought, hand and foot, hearing and sight, all gather strength.","By day they expend these powers.","So all things appear in opposition, but to the wise they all work together and are not opposed.","Show me an evil in this world without good, or a good thing without evil.","For instance, a man intent on murder becomes preoccupied with the mans wife, and as a result he sheds no blood.","There is no doubt that taking the mans wife is evil, but since this saves her husbands life she also sees this as good.","Therefore evil and good are one thing and inseparable.","This is our main quarrel with the Magians.","They say there are two Gods: the creator of good and the creator of evil.","Show me good without evil — then I will admit there is a God of evil and a God of good!","This is impossible, for good can not exist without evil.","Since there is no separation between them, how can there be two creators?","Are we not arguing in opposition to you?","By all means, we most definitely are.","But we will not push this point too far, because you might wonder if the Magians are correct.","Granted, you are not sure what I have said is wrong, yet how can you be sure that it is not right?","Wretched infidel, Mohammed said, Havent you realized the threats which we have made might come true, and punishment will be visited upon the unbelievers as you have never imagined?","Then why do you not take precautions and seek after Us?","The Prophet says that Abu Bakr was superior to the other Companions, not due to his prayer and fasting, but because that special favor — the love of God — was with him.","On the resurrection day, a persons prayers will be placed in the balance along with their fasting and generosity, but once love is brought forth it cannot be contained by any balance.","Therefore, love is the root.","When you find love in your heart, then encourage it to grow.","When you see the original investment within yourself, namely the desire for God, increase it through searching.","In movement is blessing.","If you do not build on it, even the original desire will leave you.","Are you less than the earth?","Farmers turn the earth with a hoe and it yields crops.","When they abandon it, it becomes hard.","So, when you find the quest for Truth within yourself, follow it wherever it may lead.","Do not say, What use is there in following this desire?","Just go!","The profit will show itself.","Everyone goes to the store to fulfill their needs.","God bestows both the desires and the provisions for each person, but if people sit at home acting self-sufficient then their provisions will never reach them.","After all, when a little child cries, her mother feeds her.","Now, if the child stopped to think, What use is there in crying?","How could crying possibly cause milk to come?","she would stay hungry.","Therefore, crying brings her food.","This is the same as asking, What use is there in this bowing, prostrating and prayer?","Why should I do it?","Well, when you bow before a prince, the prince has compassion for you, does-nt he?","But this compassion doesnt come from the princes skin and flesh.","Should he die, or when he is asleep, then bowing to the princes body accomplishes nothing.","So we realize that the compassion of the prince is something invisible.","If we can bow to something invisible contained in skin and flesh, surely we can also bow to that Prince who is without skin and flesh.","If everything contained in skin and flesh were visible, Abu Jahl and Mohammed would have been the same, there would have been no difference between them.","An ear, to outward appearance, is the same whether deaf or hearing — there is no difference.","Their material shape is the same.","Therefore, that hearing exists invisibly and cannot be seen.","So the root of the matter is Divine grace.","You, being a prince, have two slaves.","One performs many spiritual services and makes numerous inward journeys on your behalf.","The other is idle in serving you.","Yet we see your love for the idle one is greater.","You do not intend to let the active one go unrewarded, but that is what happens.","It is impossible to determine the cause of Gods grace.","This right eye and this left eye both appear the same.","What service has the right eye performed that the left eye has not?","And the right hand — what work has it done that the left hand has not done?","Yet Divine favor has fallen on the right hand and right eye.","So too, Friday has been preferred over the rest of the days.","God has certain portions to bestow on people Other than those inscribed on the Tablet, So let everyone seek for them on Friday."," Now what service has Friday performed that the other days have not?","Yet God bestowed His grace and special mark of honor upon Friday.","If a blind person should say, I was created blind like this, it is not my fault, it will do them no good.","It will not relieve them of their suffering.","Those infidels who are fixed in unbelief — they suffer because of their unbelief.","Yet looking at the matter again, that suffering is also a Divine blessing.","When the unbelievers are at ease they forget the Source, so God reminds them through suffering.","Therefore, Hell is a place of worship and is the mosque of infidels, for there the unbelievers remember God.","In prison, suffering, and toothache, when pain comes it tears away the veil of forgetfulness.","The sufferers turn to God and pray, O Lord, O compassionate One, O God!","They are healed.","Then the veils of forgetfulness descend again and they say, Where is God?","I cannot find Him.","I cannot see Him.","Why should I even look?","How is it that when you were suffering you saw and found, but now you cannot see?","Therefore, suffering is made to prevail over you to the end, so that you will remember God.","The sinner is forgetful in times of ease and does not recollect God.","In Hell the sinner remembers night and day.","God created the world, heaven and earth, moon, sun and stars, good and evil, to remember Him, serve Him and proclaim His praise.","Since the unbelievers do not remember unless they are suffering, and since their purpose in being created was to recollect God, they are sent suffering to remember Him.","Believers, however, do not forget that suffer-ing — they see suffering as always present.","In the same way, once an intelligent child has had its feet put in stocks as punishment, they never forget the stocks.","The stupid child, however, forgets and must be put in the stocks every day.","So, too, the clever horse, once it has felt the spur, does not require the spur again.","It carries the rider for leagues without forgetting the sting of the spur.","The stupid horse, however, requires the spur every moment; it is not fit to carry anyone, so they load it with dung.","Hearing something over and over from many people carries the same authority as seeing for yourself.","For example, youve been told that you were bom to your father and mother.","You never saw this with your own eyes, but after hearing it many times from different people, you accept it as the truth.","If you were told that they were not your parents, you wouldnt listen.","Similarly, you have heard repeatedly from trusted people that Baghdad and Mecca exist.","If all those people were now to swear an oath that those cities do not exist, you would not believe them.","Therefore, when the ear has heard the same thing repeatedly from many different sources, it carries the same authority as the eye.","In the same way, if someone makes a statement that is a well-known saying handed down generation after generation, then that is not a single statement but a hundred thousand.","What is so surprising in this?","A king exercises the authority of a hundred thousand, though he is only one — if a hundred thousand should speak nothing would happen, but when he speaks it happens immediately.","While this is the way of the external world, it is even truer of the spiritual world.","You may have seen this whole world, but since you have not seen it with God in mind, then you must make the trip again.","That journey was not on My account, it was for the sake of garlic and onions.","Since you did not go about for My sake, but for another purpose, then that other purpose became a veil to you, not allowing you to see Me.","It is the same as searching earnestly for a person in the bazaar — you see nobody else, or if you see them they are only shadows.","Or when you are hunting for the solution to a problem in a book, your ears and eyes and mind are full of that one problem.","You turn the pages, yet you see nothing else.","Since you had an intention and object in mind, wherever you went you were full of that goal.","In the time of Umar, there was a certain man who had grown so old that his daughter would feed him milk and look after him like a child.","Umar said to that daughter, There is no child alive today to compare with you in your dutifulness to your father.","She replied, What you say is true, but there is a difference between what I give and what my father gave me.","I may not fall short in service to my father, but when my father raised and served me he used to tremble for my safety and concern, while I serve my father and pray night and day asking God that he may die, so the trouble he causes me may end.","If I serve my father, where can I get that same trembling he has for me?","Umar said, This woman is wiser than Umar.","He meant, I have judged by externals, while she speaks of the core.","Those who are truly wise penetrate into the core of a thing and diagnose the truth of it.","God forbid that Umar was not apprised of the truth and secrets of things, but such was the way of the Companions, that they criticized themselves and commended others.","There are many who lack the strength for presence.","They find absence more agreeable.","In the same way, brightness comes from the sun and illuminates the world, but if people stare at the suns orb all day it does them no good and their eyes become dazzled.","It would be better for them to become involved in some other task and leave the presence of the suns orb.","Similarly, to mention tasty dishes in the presence of sick people encourages them to gain strength and appetite, but the actual consumption of those dishes can do them harm.","Therefore, trembling and passionate love are necessary in the quest for God.","Whoever does not tremble must wait upon the tremblers.","No fruit ever grows on the trunk of a tree, for trunks do not tremble.","The tips of the branches tremble, and the trunk supports the tips of the branches and the fruit securely, even against the blow of an axe.","Since the trembling of the tree trunk would end in ruin, it is better for the trunk not to tremble.","It suits the trunk to be quiet to better serve the tremblers.","Since the Amirs name is Muin al-Din, he is not Ain al-Din (Essence of the Faith) because of the M added to the Ain.","Any addition to perfection is a diminution.","The addition of that M is a diminution.","In the same way, though a sixth finger is an addition, still it is a diminution.","Ahad (One) is perfection, and Ahmad is not yet in the state of perfection.","When that M is removed it becomes complete perfection.","In other words, God comprehends all — whatever you add to God is a diminution.","The number one is contained in all numbers, and without it no number could exist.","Sayed Burhan al-Din was teaching, when a fool interrupted him to say, We need some words without comparisons or likenesses.","The Sayed answered, Whoever has no likeness, come and listen to words without likeness!","After all, you are a likeness of yourself.","You are not this body.","The existence here is but a shadow of you.","If someone dies, people say, So-andso has departed.","If they were only that body, then where have they gone?","So, your outer form is an analogy of your internal being, and from your external form others can judge your inner reality.","Everything is visible because of density.","Thus, the breath in hot weather cannot be seen, but when it is cold it becomes visible due to density.","It was the duty of the Prophet to manifest the power of God and by preaching to awaken others.","It was not his job, however, to bring people to the stage of being ready to receive Gods truth — that is Gods work.","God has two attributes: wrath and loving-kindness.","The prophets are theaters for both.","To believers they are a theater of Gods love, and to unbelievers they become a theater for Gods wrath.","Those who acknowledge truth see themselves in the Prophet, hear their own voice proceeding from him, and smell their own scent in his presence.","No one denies the reality of their own self.","Therefore the prophets say to the community, We are you, and you are we, there is no strangeness between us.","Someone says, This is my hand.","Nobody asks them for proof, since their hand is a part of them.","But if they say, So-and-so is my son, then proof is demanded, for that is something separate from themselves.","Some say that love is the cause of service, but this isnt true.","Rather, the Beloveds desire is the true source of service.","If the Beloved wishes the lover to help, then the lover provides that help.","If the Beloved does not want it, then the lover gives it up.","Abandoning service is not the abandonment of love.","No, on the contrary, even if the lover performs no service, love continues working through the lovers heart.","Therefore, the root of the matter is love, and service is the branch.","When the sleeve moves, this is because the hand moves.","But this does not mean the sleeve always follows the hand.","For instance, someone has a gown so large that when they move around, the gown does not move.","We have all seen that.","But what is not possible, is that the gown can move without the person moving.","Some people have mistaken the gown for a person, have considered the sleeve a hand, and imagined the boot to be a foot.","Yet this hand and foot are the sleeve and boot of another hand and foot.","They say, So-and-so is under the foot of So-and-so, and So-and-so has a hand in so many things.","Surely, when we speak of such a hand and foot we do not mean this hand and foot.","That Prince came and assembled us and then departed.","In the same way, the bee unites the wax with the honey and then flies away.","This is because our creation was a condition, but, after all, Gods eternity is not a condition.","Our mothers and fathers are like bees, uniting the seeker with the sought, and assembling together the lover and beloved.","Then one day they suddenly fly away.","God has made them a means for uniting the wax and the honey, and then they fly away, while the wax and honey remains.","But they do not fly out of the garden.","This is not the kind of garden that is possible to leave.","Rather, they go from one comer of the garden to another.","Our body is like a beehive, assembled from the wax and honey of the love of God.","Although the bees, our mothers and fathers, brought that honey and wax together, yet they too are tended by the gardener, and therefore it is the gardener who also makes the beehive.","God gives those bees a form appropriate to the work they are doing, but when they depart into the other world they change garments, for there a different work proceeds.","Still, those people are the same as they were in the first place.","For example: a man goes into battle, puts on his battledress, girds on armor and places a helmet on his head to prepare for combat.","But when he comes home to the feast he takes off those garments, since food and family are another business.","Still, he is the same person.","However, if you last saw him in that garment, then whenever you think of him, you will picture him in that shape and dress, even though he may have changed clothes a hundred times.","A woman loses a ring in a certain place.","Though the ring has been moved, she still circles around that spot, implying, It was here that I lost it.","In the same way, a bereaved man circles around the grave, ignorantly circumambulating about the earth and kissing it, implying, I lost that ring here, yet how could it still be there?","God performs so many wonderful works to display His omnipotence.","It is here, for the sake of Divine wisdom, that He brings together spirit and body for a day or two.","People are afraid of death.","They think that by sitting with a corpse in a tomb, even for a moment, they could go mad.","Why then, once they are released from the trap of form and the tomb of the body, why would they remain nearby?","God has appointed the sight of a grave to strike fear into our hearts as a token, and to renew that fear of death again and again.","In the same way, when a caravan has been ambushed in a certain place on the road, two or three stones are placed together there to act as a waysign, saying, Here is a place of danger.","Graves are also visible waysigns showing a place of danger.","Fear makes its mark on you, even though it is not always realized.","For instance, if people say to you, So-and-so is afraid of you, an affection immediately manifests toward them.","If, on the contrary, they say, So-andso is not in the least afraid of you, and They have no worry about you at all, simply because of these words an anger appears in your heart.","This running about in life is the effect of fear.","All the world is running, but each being runs in a different way.","The human beings chasing or running away is of one kind, the pursuit and aversions of a plant are not the same, and the running of spirit is all together different.","For example, the running of the spirit is without visible step or sign.","And consider the unripe grape, how much it pursues sweetness until it attains the blackness of the ripe grape.","That running is invisible and imperceptible, but when the grape reaches that stage, it realizes what it had been chasing for so long.","Similarly, someone enters the water without being seen by anyone, but when that persons head suddenly sticks out in the middle of the water, then everyone realizes how much swimming has been done to reach that point.","Lovers have heartaches no cure can mend, neither sleeping, traveling, nor eating — only the sight of the beloved.","Meet the Friend and your sickness will end.","This is so true that even if a hypocrite sits in the company of believers, under their influence that hypocrite can become a believer in an instant.","So God declares: When they meet those who believe, They will say, We believe.","How then, when a believer sits with a believer?","Since such company has this effect on a hypocrite, consider what benefits it brings to the believer!","Consider how wool, in the hands of a wise weaver becomes a beautiful carpet, and this earth, through association with creative builders becomes a fine palace!","Since the society of intelligent people has such an effect on inanimate things, then imagine what effect the society of believers has on the believer!","Through association with beings of even limited intellect, inanimate things can take on great forms and beauty.","These creations are all the shadow of partial intellects, and from these shadows you can understand the creators, themselves.","So, then, deduce the Intellect and Being that casts the shadow of yonder heavens, the moon and sun, the seven layers of the earth, and all that lies between the earth and heaven.","All these are the shadow of the Universal Intellect.","The shadow of a limited being is proportionate to the shadow of its body.","The shadow of the Universal Being, which is all of Creation, is proportionate to That.","The saints have seen other heavens besides these heavens.","This world is unimpressive and lowly next to what they have been shown.","The saints have set their foot upon those heavens and transcended them.","Heavens there are in the province of the soul That hold our worldly heaven in their control."," Why is it so amazing that a certain person, out of all of humanity, should discover the particular quality necessary to set foot upon the head of the seventh heaven?","Are we not all made of the same substance as the earth?","Yet God implanted in us a quality that distinguishes us from the earth, putting us in control of that substance.","We can control it however we choose — now lifting it up, now setting it down.","Now we fashion it into a palace, now we make it a cup and goblet.","Now we stretch it out, now we shorten it.","Perhaps we were first made of this very earth and a part of it, but God has distinguished us by means of that faculty.","In the same way, what is so hard to believe about the fact that out of the midst of us, who are all of the same race, God should distinguish a certain one, and that in relation to him we are like an inanimate thing, he controlling us, we being unaware of him, while he is aware of us?","When I say unaware,I do not mean utterly unaware.","Rather, everyone who focuses their attention on one thing is unaware of something else.","Even earth, inanimate as it is, is aware of what God has given it.","For if it were unaware, how could it be receptive to water, and how could it nurse and nourish every seed?","When people apply themselves earnestly and completely to a particular task, their concentration on that task leaves them unaware of anything else.","But this inattention does not mean total inattention.","For example, some people try to catch a cat, but it eludes them every time.","Then one day that cat is so preoccupied with hunting a bird, that it does not see them approaching, and they catch it.","It is not necessary to become totally preoccupied with worldly affairs.","We should take things easily, and not get caught up in bondage to them, lest in becoming disturbed we might distress something greater.","The Treasure must not be disturbed, for if this world should worry, That Other will transform it, but if That Other is vexed (may we seek refuge with God!) then who will transform That?","If, for instance, you have many kinds of cloth, when you are absorbed, which of them will you clutch?","Though they all may be indispensable, still it is certain that from your bundle you will choose something precious, something to be treasured, for with the value of one pearl and a single ruby you can produce a thousand ornaments.","From a certain tree, sweet fruit grows.","Although that fruit is only one part, yet God has chosen and distinguished that part above the whole, for in it God deposited a sweetness that He did not deposit in the rest.","By virtue of that flavor, that part became superior to the whole, and proved the pith and purpose of the tree.","So God declares: Nay, but they wonder that a warmer has come to them from amongst themselves."," A certain person said, I have attained a state in which neither Mohammed nor the angel near the Throne is contained.","The Sheikh replied, What is so amazing about having a state where Mohammed is not contained?","Yet Mohammed does not have even one state in which a stinking creature like you is not contained!","A certain jester wanted to restore the king to a better mood.","Everyone had offered him a certain sum to accomplish this, for the king was deeply vexed.","The king was walking angrily along the bank of a river.","The jester walked on the other side, across from the king.","But the king would not pay the slightest attention to the jester, he just kept staring into the water.","The jester, becoming desperate, said, O king, what do you see in the water?","The king replied, I see the husband of an unfaithful wife.","The jester said, Your slave is also not blind.","So, you may have a time when Mohammed is not contained, but Mohammed does not have a state where such a stinking creature is not contained.","After all, this spiritual state you have discovered is due to his blessing and influence.","For, first, all gifts are showered on him, then they are distributed from him to others.","Such is the rule.","God said, O Prophet, We have scattered all gifts upon thee.","Said Mohammed, And upon Gods righteous servants!","The way to God is exceedingly fearful and blocked deep by snow.","Mohammed risked his life, driving his horse through and opening up the road.","Whoever goes on this road, does so by his guidance and guarding.","He discovered the road in the first place, and set up waymarks everywhere, posting signs that say, Do not go in this direction, and do not go that way.","If you go that way you will perish, even as the people of Ad and Thamud, but if you go in this direction you will be saved, like the believers.","All of the Koran expounds this, for therein are clear signs — in other words, upon this road We have given waymarks.","If anyone tries to destroy any of these signs, everyone will attack them, saying, Why do you destroy the road for us?","Why do you work toward our destruction?","Are you a highway robber?","Know that Mohammed is the guide.","God says, Until you first come to Mohammed you cannot reach Us.","This is like when you decide to go somewhere; thought leads the way, saying, Go to this place, it is in your best interests.","After that your eyes act as a guide, and then your limbs begin to move, all in that order.","But the limbs have no knowledge of eyes, nor the eyes of thought.","Though some people are forgetful, other people do not forget them.","But if you work hard in pursuit of this world, you forget your real concern.","You must seek Gods approval, not the approval of society.","Approval, love and affection are only on loan in us, being placed there by God.","If God so wishes, there is no comfort or joy even with all the means of ease, bread and luxury provided — everything becomes pain and affliction.","All of these secondary conditions are like a pen in the hand of Gods omnipotence.","God is the mover and writer.","Until He decides, the pen does not move.","Your eye is fixed on the pen, and you say, There must be a hand to this pen.","You see the pen, but you do not see the hand.","But seeing the pen, you remember the hand.","There are those, however, who always see the hand.","They say, There must also be a pen in this hand.","But seeing the beauty of the hand, they do not care about the pen.","They simply say, Such a hand cannot be without a pen.","While you are so delighted with beholding the pen that you forget the hand, they are so delighted with the hand, how could they care for the pen?","While you find so much pleasure in barley bread that you never try wheat bread, they have wheat bread, so how could they care about barley bread?","If He has given you such joy upon earth that you have no desire for heaven — the true place of joy — and since earth derives its life from heaven, then likewise, why should the inhabitants of heaven remember earth?","Therefore, do not think that happiness and pleasure come from secondary causes, for those realities are merely on loan.","It is He who brings pain or gain, for all pain and profit come from Him.","Why do you cling so tightly to secondary causes?","The best words are those that are few and telling.","The best words convey a lesson without going on and on.","Though in the Koran the Sura, Say, He is One, is short, still it is superior to the Sura of The Cow, which is much longer, because of the message it contains.","Noah preached for a thousand years and four people rallied around him.","We all know how long Mohammed preached, yet the people of so many climes believe in him, and so many saints and pegs appeared because of him.","A lot or a little is no way to judge.","The true object is the lesson received.","With some, a few words may convey the lesson better than many.","In the same way, if the fire of a stove is too fierce you cannot even approach it, so how can you gain any benefit from it?","But there are a thousand advantages with a feeble lamp.","Hence, it is the benefit gained that is the true objective.","With some people it is best not to hear any words at all — it is enough for them to see.","That is what profits them most, and if they hear any words it actually harms them.","A certain Sheikh from India came to visit a great saint.","When he reached Tabriz and came to the door of the saints cell, he heard a voice from within saying, Return home!","For you have attained your need in coming to this door.","To see the saint would harm you.","A few words that convey a lesson are like a lit lamp that kisses an unlit lamp and then departs.","That was enough for him, he had attained his purpose.","After all, the prophet is not that visible form, that form is only the steed of the prophet.","The prophet is that Divine love and affection that is immortal.","Someone asked: Then why dont they only praise God upon the minaret?","Why do they also mention Mohammed?","Rumi answered: Well, praising Mohammed is praising God.","It is like saying, Long live the king, and long live that friend who led me to the king, and told me of the kings good name and attributes!","Praising that friend is praising the king.","The Prophet said, Give me something.","I am in need.","Either give me your cloak, your wealth, or your clothes.","Now, what would he do with your cloak or wealth?","He wants to lighten your garment, so that the warmth of the sun can reach you.","And lend to God a good loan.","He does not want wealth and cloak alone.","After all, He has given you many things besides wealth: knowledge, thought, wisdom and vision.","He means, Expend on Me a moments thought, care and consideration, since this wealth you gain comes through these gifts I have given.","God asks for alms from bird and snake alike.","If you can go before the sun naked, all the better, for that Sun does not burn black, it turns you white.","Or at least lighten your clothes to feel the joy of that Sun.","You have become accustomed to bitterness.","At least for a while try sweetness too!","Every science learned in this world through study and experiment is the science of bodies.","The science acquired by crossing the portal of death is the science of Soul.","Knowing about the science of I am God is the science of bodies, but to become I am God is the science of Soul.","To see the light of the lamp and the fire is the science of bodies, to burn in that fire and lamps flame is the science of Soul.","Everything experienced is the science of Soul, everything based upon knowledge is the science of bodies.","You could also say that the only truth is seeing and vision — all else is the science of fantasy.","For example, an architect thinks through and imagines the building of a school.","No matter how correct and accurate the architects thoughts, still it is fantasy.","It becomes reality only after builders actually raise and construct the school.","Now, there are differences between fantasy and fantasy.","The fantasy of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali is superior to the fantasy of the Companions.","Between one persons fantasy and anothers are great differences.","An expert architect pictures building a house.","Another person who is not an architect also imagines a house.","However, the differences are great because the architects fantasy is closer to reality.","It is the same in the world of realities and vision, there are differences between one persons vision and the vision of others.","They say there are seven hundred veils of darkness and seven hundred veils of light.","Well, all the worlds of fantasy are veils of darkness, and all the worlds of realities are veils of light.","But between those veils of darkness, there is no knowledge that can grasp their extreme subtlety, and despite the vast and enormous variation between the worlds of realities, those differences can never be comprehended by the mind.","Those who are living in Hell are happier there than they would be in this world, for in Hell their awareness turns to God, while in this world they forget.","Nothing is sweeter than the awareness of God.","Therefore, their desire to return to this world is to work and carry out deeds so that they can witness the manifestation of Divine grace, not because this world is a happier place than Hell.","  Hypocrites are consigned to the lowest place in Hell, because they were shown the faith but their unbelief was stronger.","They did nothing with the gift they were given.","Their punishment is more severe so they can become aware of God.","To the unbelievers, faith never came.","Their unbelief is not as strong, and so they become aware through less punishment.","Between pants with dust upon them, and a carpet with dust, the trousers only need one person to shake them a little to become clean, while it takes four people shaking the rug violently to rid the carpet of its dust.","The inhabitants of Hell cry: Pour upon us water, or of that God has provided you..."," God forbids their desire for food or drink, therefore this saying means, Pour upon us from what you have found, and shines upon you.","The Koran is like a bride who does not show her face to you even when you draw aside the veil.","The fact that you have examined her, and yet have not attained happiness or mystical unveiling, is a sign that your act of trying to remove her veil has itself repulsed her, so that she appears to you as ugly.","She says, I am no beautiful bride.","The Koran shows itself in whatever form it pleases.","But if you do not try drawing aside the veil, and seek only the Korans good pleasure, watering its fields, attending it from afar, working upon whatever pleases it best, then it will show you its face without any effort at drawing aside the veil.","Seek the people of God, for God does not speak to every one, just as the kings of this world do not speak to every weaver.","They have appointed viziers and deputies to show the way to the king.","God has also chosen certain servants, so that whoever seeks God can find God in them.","All the prophets have come for this reason — only they are the Way.","Siraj al-Din said: I was speaking to someone about a problem when something within me began to ache.","Rumi said: That something is put in charge of you to prevent you from speaking when you should not speak.","Usually it is so subtle that it goes unnoticed, but when you feel that yearning, compulsion and pain, then you know there is something in control.","For instance, you enter a pool of water and the softness of the flowers and fragrant herbs reach you, but when you get to the other side thorns prick you.","Then you realize that one side is a thorn-bed and pain, while the other side is a flowerbed and comfort.","These differences affect us through our emotions, yet they are closer to us than anything external.","Hunger and thirst, anger and happiness — all these are invisible, yet they affect us more than anything we can see.","For if you close your eyes, you can no longer see the perceptible, but this will not drive hunger away.","In the same way, spice in hot dishes, sweetness and bitterness in foods, these cannot be seen, yet their taste has a much stronger effect upon us than how the food looks.","Why do you worry about this body?","Why are you so attached to it?","You live without it.","You are always without it.","When nighttime comes you forget it, but once the day arrives you are absorbed in your bodys affairs.","But you are never truly with the body, so why tremble over its concerns.","You are not with it for a single hour, but are always elsewhere.","Where are you, and where is the body?","You are in one valley, and I am in another.","This body is a great deception.","Pharaohs magicians paused for an instant, like a speck of dust hanging in the air, and gave up their forms, for they knew they lived apart from the body, and the body was not them.","In the same way, Abraham, Ishmael and all the prophets and saints, having paused, were indifferent to whether the body existed or not.","Hajjaj, who smoked hashish, once shouted, Do not move the door or my head will fall off!","He thought his head was disconnected from his body and stayed in place only through its connection to the door.","It is the same with all people — we think we are connected with the body and depend upon it for survival.","He created Adam in His likeness.","Everyone is seeking the manifestation of God.","For example, there are many veiled women who uncover their faces to try the object of their desire, like you try a razor.","There are lovers who say to their beloved, I have not slept and I have not eaten.","I have become like this and that without you.","What they mean is, You are seeking a manifestation of God.","I am the manifestation you can vaunt your belovedness upon.","In the same way, all scholars and learned people are seeking to manifest Gods desire, I was a hidden treasure, and I desired to be known.","He created Adam in His likeness, meaning in the likeness of Gods laws.","Divine law is manifest in all creation, because all things are the shadow of God, and the shadow is like the person.","If the five fingers spread out, the shadow also spreads out.","If the body bows, the shadow also bows.","If it stretches out, the shadow also stretches out.","Therefore, all people seek a Beloved, for they all desire to be lovers of God, enemies to His enemies, and friends to His friends.","All these are the rules and attributes of God that appear in the shadow.","To sum up, this shadow world is unaware of who we really are, yet we are aware.","But in comparison to Gods knowledge, this awareness of ours is unawareness.","Not everything in a person shows in their shadow, only certain things.","So not all the attributes of God show in this shadow world, only some of them, for You have been given of knowledge nothing Except a little.","Jesus was asked, What is the most difficult thing in this world and the next?","He said, The wrath of God.","They asked, And what can save us from that?","He answered, Master your own wrath and anger towards others.","When the mind wants to complain, do the opposite — give thanks.","Exaggerate the matter to such a degree that you find within yourself a love of what repels you.","Pretending thankfulness is a way of seeking the love of God.","Our Master, Shams, said, To complain of creation is to complain of the Creator.","He also said, Hatred and rage lay hidden in your unconscious.","If you see a spark leap from that fire, extinguish it, so that it will return to nonexistence from where it came.","If you insist on matching anger with anger and promoting the flame of rage, it will spring faster and faster from your unconscious, and become more and more difficult to put out.","Chase away evil with something good, and you triumph over your enemy in two ways.","One way is this — your enemy is not another persons flesh and skin, it is the contagiousness of their hatred.","When that is cast out of you by an abundance of thanks, it will inevitably be cast out of your enemy as well, because everyone instinctively responds to kindness, and you have left your opponent with nothing to fight against.","It is just like with children, when they shout names at someone and that person yells bad names back, they are all the more encouraged, thinking, Our words have had an effect.","But if the enemy sees their words bring about no change they lose interest.","The second benefit is this: When the attribute of forgiveness comes forth in you, other people realize they have not been seeing you as you truly are.","Then they know that they are the ones to be reproached, not you, and no proof puts adversaries to shame more than that.","So by praising and giving thanks to detractors you are administering an antidote to that hatred in them, for while they have shown you your deficiency, you have shown them your perfection.","Those who are loved by God can hardly be defective.","Thus, let us praise those who criticize us, so their friends will think, It is our friends who are at odds with the Sufis, since the Sufis always speak well to our friends.","Though they are powerful, Pluck out their beards politely.","Firmly break their necks, Though they are high and mighty.","May God assist us in that!","Between the human being and God are just two veils — health and wealth — all other veils come from these.","Those who are healthy do not look for God and do not see Him, but as soon as pain afflicts them they cry out, O God!","O God!","calling out and surrendering to God.","Therefore, health is their veil and God is hidden in their pain.","As long as people have wealth, they gratify their desires, and are preoccupied night and day with pleasures.","The moment poverty appears, their spirits are weakened and they turn to God.","Drunkenness and poverty brought You to me, I am the slave of Your drunkenness and need!","God granted to Pharaoh four hundred years of life, kingship and enjoyment.","All that was a veil, which kept him far from the presence of God.","He did not even experience a single day of disagreeableness and pain, so that he would completely forget God.","God said, Go on being preoccupied with your own desire, and do not even think of me.","Good night!","King Solomon grew weaiy of his reign, But Job was never sated of his pain.","Rumi said: Some people say that in the human soul is an evil not found in animals and wild beasts, but this does not mean that people are worse than beasts.","Rather, this evil character and darkness of soul in the human being hides a secret essential element.","The more precious and noble that element is, the greater the veil to hide it, and such veils cannot be removed without great effort.","These struggles are of various kinds.","The greatest is to spend time with friends who have turned their faces to God and turned their backs on this world.","There is no more difficult combat than this, for the very sight of them dissolves our ego and worldly desires.","That is why they say that if a snake has seen no human for forty years it becomes a dragon, since it has seen no one who could stop the growth of its own evil nature.","Wherever men or women put a big lock, that is a sign of something precious and valuable.","Just like the snake that guards a treasure, do not regard a persons ugliness, but look instead at the preciousness of their treasure.","The difference between birds on the wing, and lovers of God, is that birds always fly in a certain direction, while lovers of God fly on the wings of their desire away from all directions.","Every horse has its stable, every beast its pen, every bird its nest.","And God knows best.","What excuses have you to offer, my heart, for so many shortcomings?","Such constancy on the part of the Beloved, such unfaithfulness on your own!","So much generosity on his side, on yours such niggling contrariness!","So many graces from him, so many faults committed by you!","Such envy, such evil imaginings and dark thoughts in your heart, such drawing, such tasting, such munificence by him!","Why all this tasting?","That your bitter soul may become sweet.","Why all this drawing?","That you may join the company of the saints.","You are repentant of your sins, you have the name of God on your lips; in that moment he draws you on, so that he may deliver you alive.","You are fearful at last of your wrongdoings, you seek desperately a way to salvation; in that instant why do you not see by your side him who is putting such fear into your heart?","If he has bound up your eyes, you are like a pebble in his hand; now he rolls you along like this, now he tosses you in the air.","Now he implants in your nature a passion for silver and gold and women; now he implants in your soul the light of the form of Mustafa.","On this side drawing you towards the lovely ones, on that side drawing you to the unlovely; amid these whirlpools the ship can only pass through or founder.","Offer up so many prayers, weep so sorely in the night season, that the echo may reach your ears from the sphere of the seven heavens.","When Shu‘aib’s groaning and lamentation and tears like hailstones passed beyond all bounds, in the morning a proclamation came to him from heaven: If you are a sinner, I have forgiven you and granted you pardon for your sins.","Is it paradise you seek?","Lo, I have given it to you; be silent, cease these petitions!","Shu‘aib retorted, I seek neither this nor that.","What I desire is to see God face to face; though the seven seas all turn to fire, I will plunge therein if only I may encounter Him.","But if I am banished from that spectacle, if my tear-stained eyes are shut against that vision, I am more fit to dwell in hellfire; paradise becomes me not.","Without His countenance, paradise for me is hateful hell.","I am consumed by this hue and scent of mortality; where is the splendour of the lights of immortality?","They said, At least moderate your weeping, lest your sight be diminished, for the eye becomes blind when weeping passes beyond bounds.","He said, If my two eyes in the end should be seeing after that fashion, every part of me will become an eye: why then should I grieve over blindness?","But if in the end this eye of mine should be deprived forever, let that sight indeed become blind which is unworthy to behold the Beloved!","In this world, every man would become a ransom for his beloved; one man’s beloved is a bag of blood, another’s the sun in splendour.","Since every man has chosen a beloved, good or bad, as suits his own nature, it would be a pity if we should annihilate ourselves for the sake of nothing!","One day a traveller was accompanying Ba Yazld on a certain road.","Presently Ba Yazld said to him, What trade have you chosen, you rogue?","The man replied, I am an ass-driver.","Ba Yazld exclaimed, Be gone from me!","— Lord, grant that his ass may die, that he may become the slave of God!","O lovers, lovers, this day you and we are fallen into a whirlpool: who knows how to swim?","Though the world’s forrent should overflow and every wave become like a dromedary, why shall the waterfowl worry?","It is the bird of the air that should be anxious.","Our faces are lighted up with gratitude, schooled as we are in wave and sea, inasmuch as ocean and flood are life-increasing to the fish.","Elder, hand us a towel; water, let us plunge into you; Moses son of ‘Imran, come, smite the water of the sea with your staff!","This wind concocts in every head a different passion; let my passion be for yonder cupbearer, and you may have all the rest!","Yesterday yon saki on the way snatched the caps of the drunkards; today he is giving yet more wine, preparing to strip us of our robes.","O envy of the Moon and of Jupiter, with us, yet hidden from sight like a peri, gendy, gently you are drawing me on — will you not say whither?","Wherever you go, you are with me still, you who are my eyes and my brightness; if you will, draw me to drunkenness, if you will, transport me to annihilation.","Know that the world is like Mount Sinai, and we like Moses are seekers; every moment an epiphany arrives and cleaves the mountain asunder.","One portion becomes green, one portion becomes narcissuswhite; one portion becomes a pearl, one portion ruby and amber.","You who seek to behold Him, gaze upon this mountainchain of His.","O mountain, what wind has blown upon you?","We have become intoxicated with the echo.","O gardener, gardener, why have you come to grapple with us?","If we have carried off your grapes, you have carried off our purse!","Today I beheld the beloved, that ornament of every affair; he went off departing to heaven like the spirit of Mustafa.","The sun is put to shame by his countenance, heaven’s sphere is as confused as the heart; through his glow, water and clay are more resplendent than fire.","I said, Show me the ladder, that I may mount up to heaven.","He said, Your head is the ladder; bring your head down under your feet.","When you place your feet on your head, you will place your feet on the head of the stars; when you cleave through the air, set your foot on the air, so, and come!","A hundred ways to heaven’s air become manifest to you; you go flying up to heaven every dawning like a prayer.","Every instant a revelation from heaven comes to men’s innermost souls: How long like dregs do you remain upon earth?","Come up!","Whoever is heavy of soul in the end proves to be dregs; only then does he mount to the top of the vat when his dregs are clarified.","Do not stir the clay every moment, so that your water may become clear, so that your dregs may be illumined, so that your pains may be cured.","It is spiritual, like a forch, only its smoke is greater than its light; when its smoke passes beyond bounds, it no longer displays radiance in the house.","If you diminish the smoke, you will enjoy the light of the forch; both this abode and that will become illumined by your light.","If you look into muddy water, you see neither the moon nor the sky; sun and moon both disappear when darkness possesses the air.","A northern breeze is blowing, through which the air becomes clarified; it is for the sake of this burnishing that at dawn the zephyr breathes.","The spiritual breeze burnishes the breast of all sorrow; let the breath be stopped but for a moment, and annihilation will come upon the spirit.","The soul, a stranger in the world, is yearning for the city of placelessness; why, O why does the bestial spirit continue so long to graze?","io Pure, goodly soul, how long will you journey on?","You are the King’s falcon; fly back toward the Emperor’s whisde!","O lovers, lovers, the time of union and encounter has come.","The proclamation from heaven has come: Moon-laced beauties, welcome hither!","Joyous hearts, joyous hearts, joy has come skirt a-trailing; we have seized its chain, it has seized our skirts.","The fiery potion has come; demon sorrow, sit in a corner; death-anxious soul, depart; immortal saki, enter in!","The seven spheres of heaven are drunk with passion for you; we are as counters in your hand; our being through your being is a myriad times at ease.","Sweet- breathed minstrel, every instant shake the bell; O gladness, saddle your steed; O zephyr, blow upon our souls!","O sound of the sweet-conversing reed, in your note is the taste of sugar; your note brings me night and morning the scent of fidelity.","Make beginning again, play those airs once more; O sun lovely of presence, glory over all the lovely ones!","Be silent, do not rend the veil; drain the flagon of the silent ones; be a veiler, be a veiler, habituate yourself to the clemency of God.","How sweet it is to give speech and head, to converse with his lip, especially when he opens the door and says, Good sir, come in!","To the dry lip he tells the story of the fountain of Khidar; according to the stature of the man the tailor of his love cuts the gown.","The fountains become drunken through the intoxication of his eye; the trees are dancing before the gentle breeze of dawn.","The nightingale says to the rosebush, What is in your heart?","Declare it this instant.","No other is near; only you and I.","The rosebush answers, So long as you are with yourself, entertain not this ambition.","Make a special effort to transport the burden of your selfhood out of this earthly abode.","The eye of the needle of passion is narrow; know for a certainty that it will not admit any thread when it perceives it to be of double strand.","Behold how the sun is up to the throat in fire, so that through its face the face of the earth may become full oflight.","When Moses proceeded towards the burning bush, the bush said, I am the water of Kauthar; take off your shoes, and come!","Do not fear my fire, for I am water and sweet at that; you have come to prosperity; the seat of honour is yours, welcome!","io You are a pearl of pure lustre, a ruby of the mine, the soul of place and placelessness; you are the nonpareil of the age; where are other creatures beside you?","Through love’s hand, every hand becomes the royal court of munificence; through you, the faithless world becomes the factory of fidelity.","At the first hour of day you came, in your hand the royal bowl; you are drawing my soul towards the feast, saying, Welcome!","What becomes of the heart, when the heart’s hand grasps the hand of a sweetheart?","What becomes of the dross copper, when it hears the welcoming voice of the philosopher’s stone?","A wondrous darling came, in his hand a lance, like a bedouin.","I said, What service can I render?","He said, Come up to me!","My heart leaped, saying, Shall I run?","My reason said, Shall I go?","Generously he signaled, saying, Yes, both of you!","Since the table has come down from heaven, wash your hands and your mouth too, that there may not proceed from your palms the odour of onions and chives.","The mine of salt has arrived; take heed, if you are goodly and a lover.","Seize the bowl, and give the cup; choose riot, not broth!","Now I close these two lips, so that the lamp of day and night even with the flame of the tongue may tell you the whole story.","[ + The king has come, the king has come; adorn the palace-hall; cut your forearms in honour of the fair one of Canaan.","Since the Soul of the soul of the soul has come, it is not meet to mention the soul; in his presence of what use is the soul, save as a sacrifice?","Without love I was one who had lost the way; of a sudden love entered.","I was a mountain; I became a straw for the horse of the king.","Whether he be Turk or Tajik, this slave is near to him even as soul to body; only the body does not behold the soul.","Ho, my friends, good luck has arrived; the time has come for offering up the load; a Solomon has come to the throne, to depose Satan.","Leap from your place; why do you tarry?","Why are you so helpless?","If you know it not, seek from the hoopoe the way to Solomon’s palace.","There make your litanies, there utter your secrets and your needs; Solomon indeed knows the speech of all the birds.","Speech is a wind, O slave, and distracts the heart; but he commands it, Gather together the scattered ones!","Have you ever seen any lover who was satiated with this passion?","Have you ever seen any fish that had become satiated with this sea?","Have you ever seen any image that was fleeing from the engraver?","Have you ever seen any Vamiq asking pardon of ‘Adhra?","In separation, the lover is like a name empty of meaning; but a meaning such as belovedness has no need of names.","You are the sea, I am a fish — hold me as you desire; show compassion, exercise kingly power — without you, I remain alone.","Puissant emperor, what dearth of compassion is this then?","The moment you are not present, the fire rages so high.","If the fire beholds you, it withdraws to a corner; for whoever plucks a rose from the fire, the fire bestows a lovely rose.","Without you, the world is a forment; may it not be without you for a single instant; by your life I implore this, for life without you is a forture and an agony to me","Your image like a sultan was parading within my heart, even as a Solomon entering the Temple of Jerusalem; Thousands oflanterns sprang into flame, all the temple was illumined; paradise and the Pool of

of my soul, gay company makes me not happy, neither does wine intoxicate me.","Then if he replies coquettishly, Be gone!","What do you want of me?","I fear that your melancholy may make me melancholic"," — I would bring sword and windingsheet and bow my neck as a sacrificial offering, saying, Your head is aching because of me; strike deliberately!","You know that I desire not to live without you; better for me is death than banishment, by God who brings the dead to life.","I never could believe that you would turn away from your servant; I ever said, the words spoken by my enemies are lying inventions.","You are my soul, and without my soul I know not how to live; you are my eyes, and without you I have not a seeing eye.","Let go these words; minstrel, strike up an air; bring forward rebeck and tambourine, if you do not have a reed pipe.","IO Today give in full measure that pure wine; strike in utter confusion this hasty wheel of heaven.","Even granted that the unseen bowl has come hidden from the eyes, it is not possible to conceal drunkenness and depravity.","Love, whose trade is joy, sweet of speech and sweet of thought, snatch now the veil from the face of that veiled king; Auspicious one, that cries of exultation may arise from this side and that, ho, fill up, rosy of cheek, flagon and bowl.","If you do not wish the rosebower to be disclosed, why did you open the rosewater shop?","Having robbed us of our senses and set this river flowing, fling into the water with all speed the water-duckling.","O soul, we are as corn sprung in this expanse, dry oflip and seeking with our lives the cloud-borne rain.","On every side a new messenger declares, You will never find; depart!","Cry God forfend against that ill-omened crow.","Riot -provoker of every spirit, purse-robber of every Goha, filching the rebeck from the hand of Bu Baler the Lutanist, Today I desire that you should intoxicate and craze this chatterbox soul, that wordy reason.","Water oflife to us, become manifest as the resurrection, what though the milk of the scabby camel is life to the bedouin.","Very lovely is your majesty and beauty; be silent and hold your breath, make not aware of us every heedless one drowned in slumber.","II Like the rose I am laughing with all my body, not only with my mouth, because I am without myself, alone with the king of the world.","You who came with forch and at dawn ravished my heart, dispatch my soul after my heart, do not seize my heart alone","Do not in rage and envy make my soul a stranger to my heart; do not leave the former here, and do not summon the latter alone.","Send a royal message, issue a general invitation; how long, sultan, shall the one be with you and the other alone?","If you do not come tonight as yesterday and close my lips, will make a hundred uproars, my soul, I will not lament alone.","Come, you who have given new life to the world, put out of action cunning reason.","Until you flight me like an arrow, I cannot fly; come, fill once more the bow.","Because of your love, the bowl has fallen again from the roof; once more send down from the roof that ladder.","[ + Men ask me, In which direction is His roof?","In that direction whence the soul was brought; In that direction whither every night the soul departs, then in the time of dawn He brings back the soul; In that direction whence spring comes to the earth, and at dawn He bestows a new lamp upon the heavens; In that direction whence a staff became a serpent, and He bore off Pharaoh’s host to hell; In that direction whence arose this quest in you — itself a token, it seeks a token.","You are that man who is seated upon an ass, and keeps asking of the ass this and that.","io Be silent; for out of jealous regard He desires not to bring all and sundry into the sea.","Do you break our harp, exalted one; thousands of other harps are here.","Since we have fallen into the clutches of love, what matters it if we lose harp or reed pipe?","If the whole world’s rebeck and harp should be consumed, many a hidden harp there is, my friend; The twanging and strumming mounts to the skies, even if it does not enter the ears of the deaf.","If the whole world’s lamp and candle should flicker out, what cause for sorrow is that, since flint and steel still remain?","Songs are spindrift on the face of the sea; no pearl comes on the surface of the sea; Yet know that the grace of the spindrift derives from the pearl, the reflection of the reflection of whose gleam is upon us.","Songs are all but a branch of the yearning for union; branch and root are never comparable","Close your lips, and open the window of the heart; by that way be conversant with the spirits.","O soul and stay of every soul, who bestow wings and set the spirits in motion, With you, what fear have we of loss, you who convert all losses to gain?","Alas for the arrows of the glances and the brows curved like bows!","You have sugared the ruby lips of fair idols, you have opened those mouths in desire.","You who have put a key in our hand and therewith opened the door of the worlds, If you be not in the midst of us, then why are those waists close -girdled?","And if yours is not the wine without token, of what are these tokens testimony?","And if you are beyond our surmise, yet through whom are these surmises living?","And if you are hidden from our world, from whom do the hidden things become manifest?","Let go the tales of this world; we have grown aweary of them.","The soul that has fallen into the sugar-sprinkler — how should such things be contained in its heart?","He who has become the earth for your feet, how should he be mindful of the heavens?","Bind up our tongue with your protection; cast us not forth into the midst of these tongues.","I beheld the lovely rosebower face, that eye and lamp of all brightness, That altar betore which the soul prostrates, that gladness and place of security.","The heart said, I will yield up my soul there, I will let go of being and selfhood.","The soul also joined in the concert and began to clap hands.","Reason came and said, What shall I say regarding this good fortune and sublime felicity, This scent of a rose that made upright as a cypress every back that was curved and bent double?","In love all things are transformed; Armenian is changed to Turk.","Soul, you have attained to the Soul of the soul; body, you have abandoned bodihood.","The ruby is the alms of our Beloved; the dervish eats the gold of the Rich; io That Mary in anguish discovers anew dates fresh and ripe.","Lest the eye of a stranger should fall upon it, do not show off your good deed to men; If your desire from faith is security, seek your security in seclusion.","What is the place of seclusion?","The house of the heart; become habituated to dwell in the heart; In the heart’s house is delivered that bowl of wholesome and everlasting wine.","Be silent, and practise the art of silence; let go all artful bragging; For the heart is the place of faith, there in the heart hold fast to faithfulness.","Love has rose bowers amid the veil of blood; lovers have affairs to transact with the beauty of incomparable Love.","Reason says, The six directions are the boundary, and there is no way out; Love says, There is a way, and I have many times travelled it.","Reason beheld a bazaar, and began trading; Love has beheld many bazaars beyond Reason’s bazaar.","Many a hidden Mansur there is who, confiding in the soul of Love, abandoned the pulpit and mounted the scaffold.","Dreg-sucking lovers possess ecstatic perceptions inwardly; men of reason, dark of heart, entertain denials within them.","Reason says, Set not your foot down, for in the courtyard there is naught but thorns; Love says, These thorns belong to the reason which is within you.","Beware, be silent; pluck the thorn of being out of the heart’s foot, that you may behold the rosebowers within you.","Shams-i TabrizI, you are the sun within the cloud of words; when your sun arose, all speech was obliterated.","Yesterday I gave a star a message for you; I said to it, Deliver my compliments to that one fair as the moon.","Prostrating myself, I said, Convey this prostration to that sun who by his burning glow converts hard rocks to gold.","I opened my breast and showed it the wounds; I said to it, Bear tidings of me to the Beloved who delights in drinking blood.","I rocked to and fro to hush the infant of my heart; the infant sleeps when the cradle is rocked.","Give milk to the infant of my heart, deliver us from turning about, you who every moment succour a hundred helpless ones like me.","After all, in the first place the heart’s abode was the city of union; how long will you keep in exile this vagrant heart?","I have relapsed into silence; but to ward off crop-sickness turn about, O saki of the lovers, your vintner eye!","i Go forth, my comrades, draw along our beloved, at last bring to me the fugitive idol; With sweet melodies and golden pretexts draw to the house that moon sweet of presence.","And if he promises, I will come in another moment, all his promises are but cunning to beguile you.","He possesses a flaming breath, by enchantment and wizardry knotting the water and tying up the air.","When in blessedness and joy my darling enters, sit you down and behold the marvels of God!","When his beauty shines forth, what shall be the beauty of the comely ones?","For his sun-bright face extinguishes all lamps.","Go, fleet-paced heart, to Yemen, to my heart’s beloved, convey my greetings and service to that ruby beyond price","A garden — may its roses bloom till resurrection-day; an idol — may the two worlds be scattered over its beauty!","At daybreak the prince of the fair ones stalks forth to the chase — may our hearts be the quarry for the arrows of his glances!","What messages are momently flashing from his eyes to mine — may my eyes be gladdened and intoxicated by his message!","I broke down the door of an ascetic; with an imprecation he banned me: Be gone!","May your days all be without peace!","Thanks to his curse, the beloved has left me neither peace nor heart, that beloved who thirsts for my blood — may God befriend him!","My body is like the moon, melting away out oflove; my heart is like Venus’ harp — may its strings be snapped!","Regard not the moon’s melting, Venus’ broken estate; behold rather the sweetness of his sorrow — may it increase a thousand-told!","What a bride is in the soul!","Through the reflection of her face may the world be fresh and figured as the hands of the newly-wedded!","Regard not the fleshly cheek, which corrupts and decays; regard the spiritual cheek — may it be fair and lovely for ever!","The dark body is like a raven, and the physical world is winter — despite these two unlovelies, may there be spring eternal!","For these two unlovelies subsist through the four elements; may your servants subsist through other than these four!","When you display that rosy cheek, you set the stones aspinning for joy.","Once again put forth your head from the veil, for the sake of the dumbstruck lovers, That learning may lose the way, that the man of reason may break his science to pieces; That water through your reflection may convert to a pearl, that fire may abandon warfare.","With your beauty, I desire not the moon, neither those two or three hanging little lanterns.","With your face, I do not call the ancient, rusty heavens a mirror.","You breathed, and created anew in another shape this narrow world.","In desire for his Mars-like eye, play, Venus, again that harp!","The heart is like a grain of corn, we are like a mill; how does the mill know why this turning?","The body is like a stone, and the water its thoughts; the stone says, The water knows what is toward.","The water says, Ask the miller, for it was he who flung this water down.","The miller says to you, Bread-eater, if this does not turn, how shall the crumb-broth be?","Much business is in the making; silence, ask God, that He may tell you.","Here someone is hidden; suppose not that you are alone.","She has very sharp ears; do not open your tongue to evil.","That peri has taken lodging by the fountain of your heart; thereby every form of image has become manifest to you.","Wherever a fountain is, there is a place for peris; you must act cautiously there.","Since these five fountains of the senses are flowing over your body, know that it is by the superintendence of that fairy that sometimes they are stopped up, sometimes set flowing.","Know also that those five inward senses, such as imagination and conception, are likewise five fountains running towards the pasture.","Every fountain has two superintendents and fifty controllers; they disclose their forms to you in the time of burnishing.","The peris smite you if you are unmannerly, for this kind of famous peri is impetuous and shows no favour.","Determinism beguiles deliberation, saying, Now leap into action; its cunning has snatched the blanket from a hundred thousand such as we.","Behold the birds in the cage, behold the fishes in the net, behold the hearts lamenting on account of that knowing trickster.","io Open not your eye surreptitiously on any idol out of treach ery, lest that all-seeing prince cast you from his regard.","Several verses still remain, but this fountain has sunk into the ground; that will bubble up from the fountain when we leap up tomorrow.","Bring into motion your amber-scattering tress; bring into dancing the souls of the Sufis.","Sun, moon and stars dancing around the circle, we dancing in the midst — set that midst a-dancing.","Your grace minstrelwise with the smallest melody brings into the wheel the Sufi of heaven.","The breeze of spring comes hurrying, uttering a melody; it sets the world a-laughing, raises autumn from the dead.","Many a snake becomes a friend, rose partners thorn; the season of scattering largesse is come to the king of the orchard.","Every moment a perfume wafts from the garden like a message some whither, as if to say, Cry welcome today to the friends!","The orchard, departed into its secret heart, is speaking to you; do you depart into your own secret, that life may come to your soul, That the lily’s bud may open its secret to the cypress, that the tulip may bring good tidings to willow and judas-tree, That the secret of every young shoot may emerge from the depths, the ascensionists having set up a ladder in the garden.","The songbirds and nightingales are seated in the branches, like the guardian enjoying his stipend from the treasury; These leaves are like tongues, these fruits like hearts — when the hearts show their feces, they give worth to the tongue.","You who are my soul’s repose in the time of pain, you who are my spirit’s treasure in the bitterness of poverty, That which imagination never conceived, reason and understanding never perceived, has entered my soul from you; therefore to you alone I turn in worship.","Through your grace I gaze boldly upon eternal life; O king, how should a perishing empire beguile me?","The melody of that person who brings me glad tidings of you, even if it be in sleep, is better than all poets’ songs to me.","In the genuflections of prayer your image, O king, is as necessary and obligatory to me as the seven oft-repeated verses.","When unbelievers sin, you are all compassion and intercession; to me you are the chief and leader of the stonyhearted.","If everlasting bounty should offer all kingdoms and place before me every hidden treasure, I would prostrate myself with all my soul and lay my face on the earth, I would say, Out of all these, the love of a certain one for me"," For me the time of union is eternal life, for in that moment no time contains me.","io Life is a vessel, and in it union is a pure wine; without you, of what avail to me is the labour of the vessels?","Before this, twenty thousand desires were mine; in my passion for him, not one single aspiration has remained to me.","Through the succour of his grace, I have become secure from the Monarch of the Unseen saying to me, Thou shalt not see me.","The essence of the meaning of He my heart and soul has filled; he is — even though he said he is not — the third and the second to me.","Union with him transported my spirit; my body paid not attention, though disengaged from the body he became visible to me.","I have become old in grief for him; but when you name Tabriz, all my youth returns.","Again the violet bent double has arrived beside the lily, again the ruby-clad rose is tearing her gown to shreds; Again our green-gowned ones have gaily arrived from beyond the world swift as the wind, drunken and stalking and joyous.","The standard-bearing cypress went off and consumed autumn with rage, and from the mountaintop the sweet-featured anemone showed its face.","The hyacinth said to the jasmine, Peace be upon you; the latter replied, Upon you be peace; come, lad, into the meadow!","A Sufi on every side, having attained some favour, clapping hands like the plane-tree, dancing like the zephyr; The bud, concealing its face like veiled ladies — the breeze draws aside its chaddur saying, Unveil your face, good friend!","The friend is in this quarter of ours, water in this our stream; lotus in your finery, why are you athirst and pale?","Sour-faced winter has departed, that joy-slayer has been slain; swift-footed jasmine, long may you live!","The busy narcissus winked at the verdure; the verdure understood its words and said, Yours is the command.","The clove said to the willow, I am in hope of you; the willow answered, My bachelor apartment is your private chamber — welcome"," The apple said, Orange, why are you puckered?","The orange replied, I do not show myself off for fear of the evil eye.","The ringdove came cooing, Where is that friend?","The sweet-noted nightingale pointed him to the rose.","Beside the world’s springtide there is a secret spring; mooncheeked and sweet of mouth, give wine, O saki!","Moon rising in the shadows of darkness, the light of whose lamp vanquishes the sun at noon!","Several words yet remain unsaid, but it is unseasonably late; whatever was omitted in the night I will complete tomorrow.","If you are Love’s lover and in quest of Love, take a sharp dagger and cut the throat of bashfulness.","Know that reputation is a great barrier in the path; what I say is disinterested — accept it with a tranquil mind.","Why did that madman work a thousand kinds of madness, that chosen wild one invent a thousand wiles?","Now he rent his robe, now he ran over the mountains, now he quaffed poison, now he elected annihilation; Since the spider seized such huge prey, consider what prey the snare of My Lord the Most High will take!","Since the love of Laila’s face had all that worth, how will it be with He carried His servant by night?","Have you not seen the Divans of Visa and Ramin?","Have you not read the stories of Vamiq and ‘Adhra?","You gather up your garment lest the water should wet it; you must dive a thousand times into the sea.","Love’s path has proved all drunkenness and abasement, for the forrent flows downwards; how should it run upwards?","You will be as a bezel in the lovers’ ring, if you are the earringed slave of the king, my master; Just as this earth is thrall to the sky, just as the body is thrall to the spirit.","Come, say, what loss did earth suffer from this bond?","What kindnesses has not reason done to the members?","My son, it behoves not to beat the drum under a blanket; plant your flag like a brave warrior in the midst of the plain.","With your spirit’s ear listen to the thousand tumults echoing in the green dome’s air from the clamour of the passionate ones!","When the cords of your robe are loosened by Love’s intoxication, behold then the angel’s rapture, the houri’s amazement!","How all the world trembles, on high and below, because of Love, which transcends all below and on high!","When the sun has arisen, where then remains night?","When the army of grace has come, where then remains affliction?","I fell silent; Soul of the soul, do you speak, for every atom has grown articulate out of love for your face.","You have seized me by the ear — whither are you drawing me?","Declare what is in your heart, and what your purpose is.","Prince, what cauldron did you cook for me last night?","God knows what melancholy madness there is in Love!","Since the ears of heaven and earth and the stars are all in your hand, whither are they going?","Even to that place whither you said, Come!","The rest you seized only by one ear, me you seized by two; from the roots of each ear I say, Long may you endure!","When a slave grows old, his master sets him free; when I became old, He enslaved me over again.","Shall not children rise up white of hair at the resurrection?","But your resurrection has turned the old men’s hair black.","Since you bring the dead to life and make the old men young, I have fallen silent, and occupy myself with prayer.","If you do not know Love, question the nights, ask of the pale cheek and the dryness of the lips.","Just as the water relates about the stars and the moon, even so the physical forms relate about intellect and spirit.","From Love the soul learns a thousand manners of culture, such culture as cannot be found from schools.","Amongst a hundred persons, the lover stands out as plain as the shining moon in heaven amid the stars.","The mind, though it be apprised of all the doctrines of the sects, knows nothing and is bewildered by the doctrine of Love.","The man who has a heart like Khidar, who has quaffed the water of life of Love — to such a one the most limpid fountains are nothing worth.","Toil not in the garden; behold within the soul of the lover Damascus and Ghuta, rosebowers and all Nairab.","What is Damascus?","For that is a paradise full of angels and houris; minds are amazed at those cheeks and rounded chins.","Its delectable wine does not produce vomiting and cropsickness, the sweetness of its halva does not give rise to boils and fevers.","io All men, from king to beggar, are in the tug of appetite; Love delivers the soul out of all appetites and desires.","What pride does Love take in its purchasers?","What sort of a prop are foxes to the lion?","Upon the datepalm of the world I do not discover one ripe date, for all my teeth have been blunted by unripe dates.","Fly on the wings of Love in the air and to the skies, be exempt like the sun from the need of all riding-beasts.","Lovers’ hearts do not experience loneliness like simples, they have no fear of severance and separation like compounds.","Providence chose Love for the sake of the souls, the Cause purchased Love out of all things caused.","Love’s deputy entered the breast of the Cadi of Kab, so that his heart should shy from giving judgment and such prattle.","What a world!","What rare arrangement and ordering, that casts a thousand confusions into well-ordered things!","Beggar of Love, for all the joys that the world contains, reckon that Love is the gold-mine, and those things but gilded.","Love, you have filched my heart by trickery and cunning; you lied — God forfend!","— but sweetly and charmingly.","I desire to mention you, Love, with gratitude; but I am distraught with you, and my thought and reason are confused.","Were I to praise Love in a hundred thousand languages, Love’s beauty far surpasses all such stammerings.","Our desert has no bounds, our hearts and souls know no rest.","World upon world took shape and form; which of these shapes is ours?","When you see on the road a severed head which goes rolling towards our arena, Ask of it, ask of it our secrets, for from it you will hear our hidden mystery.","How would it be, if but one ear showed itself, familiar with the tongues of our birds?","How would it be if one bird took wing, having on its neck the collar of our Solomon’s secret?","What am I to say, what suppose?","For this tale transcends our bounds and possibilities.","Yet how shall I keep silence?","For every moment this distraction of ours becomes yet more distraught.","What partridges and falcons are flying with wings outspread amidst the air of our mountainland, Amidst the air, which is the seventh atmosphere, on the summit whereof is our portico!","Leave this tale; ask not of us, for our tale is broken entirely; Salah al-Haqq wa ’i-Din will display to you the beauty of our Emperor and Ruler.","A hundred drums are being beaten within our hearts, the roar of which we shall hear tomorrow.","Cotton wool in the ear, hair in the eye — that is the anxiety for tomorrow, the subtle whisper of grief; Fling Love’s flame into this cotton wool, like Hallaj and like the people of purity.","Why do you keep fire and cotton wool together?","These two are opposites, and the opposite never survived.","Since the encounter of Love is near, be joyous of presence for the day of meeting.","For us, death is gladness and encounter; if for you it is an occasion of mourning, depart hence!","Inasmuch as this present world is our prison, the ruining of prisons is surely a cause for joy.","Fie whose prison was so delightful — how shall be the court of Him who adorned the world?","Look not for constancy in this prison, for herein constancy itself never kept faith.","Hark, for I am at the door!","Open the door; to bar the door is not the sign of good pleasure.","In the heart of every atom is a courtyard for You; until You unbar it, it will remain in concealment.","You are the Splitter of Dawn, the Lord of the Daybreak; You open a hundred doors and say, Come in!","It is not I at the door, but You; grant access, open the door to Yourself.","Sulphur came to a fire; it said, Come out to me, beloved!","My form is not your form, but I am all you, my form is as a veil.","I become you in form and reality when you arrive, my form is blotted out in the encounter.","The fire replied, I have come forth; why should I veil my face from my very self?","Hark, receive from me and deliver my message to all the companions and all the kinsmen, io If it is a mountain, draw it like a straw; I have given you the quality of amber.","My amber draws the mountain; did I not bring forth Mount Hira out of nonexistence?","I am wholly and completely within your heart; {come toward your own heart — Welcome!","I am the heart-stealer and I take the heart,} for the pearl of the heart was born of my ocean.","I move my shadow, otherwise how is it that my shadow is apart from me?","But I transport it from its place so that, at the time of unveiling, its union may become manifest, So that it may realize that it is a branch of me, so that it may become separated from all other.","Go to the saki and hear the rest of it, that he may tell you it with the tongue of immortality.","The wheel of heaven, with all its pomp and splendour, circles around God like a mill.","My soul, circumambulate around such a Kaaba; beggar, circle about such a table.","Travel like a ball around in His polo-field, inasmuch as you have become happy and helpless.","Your knight and rook are circumambulating about the king, even though you move from place to place on this chessboard.","He set on your finger the royal signet so that you might become a ruler having authority.","Whoever circumambulates about the heart becomes the soul of the world, heart-ravishing.","The heart-forlorn becomes companion to the moth, he circles about the tip of the candle, Because his body is earthy and his heart of fire — congener has an inclination towards congener.","Every star circles about the sky, because purity is the congener of purity.","io The mystic’s soul circles about annihilation, even as iron about a magnet, Because annihilation is true existence in his sight, his eyes having been washed clean of squinting and error; The drunkard made ablution in urine, saying, O Lord, deliver me out of impurity.","God answered, First realize what impurity is; it is not meet to pray crookedly and topsy-turvy.","For prayer is a key; and when the key is crooked, you will not attain the favour of opening the lock.","I fall silent; all of you, leap up!","The cypress-like stature of my idol cries come!","Emperor of Tabriz, my King, Shams-i Din, I have closed my lips; do you come, and open!","The water has been cut off from this world’s river; O springtide, return and bring back the water!","— Of that water whose like the fountain of Khidar and Ilyas never saw and will never see.","Glorious fountain, through the splendour of whose gushing every moment water bubbles up from the well of the soul.","When waters exist, loaves grow; but never, my soul, did water grow from loaf.","O guest, do not beggarlike shed the water from the face of poverty for the sake of a morsel of bread.","The entire world from end to end is but half a morsel; because of greed for half a morsel, the water vanished.","Earth and heaven are bucket and pitcher; water is outside earth and heaven.","Do you also speed forth from heaven and earth, that you may behold water flowing from placelessness, That the fish of your soul may escape from this pool, and sip water from the boundless sea.","io In that sea whose fishes are all Khidars, therein the fish is immortal, immortal the water.","From that vision came the light of the eye, from that roof is the water in the spout; From that garden are these roses of the cheeks, from that waterwheel the rosebower obtains water; From that date-tree are the dates of Mary.","That water derives not from secondary causes and suchlike things.","Your soul and spirit will then become truly happy, when the water comes flowing towards you from hence.","Shake no more your rattle like a nightwatchman, for the water itself is the guardian of these fishes.","Do you not know what the rebeck says concerning tears of the eyes and burning hearts?","I am a skin far sundered from the flesh; how should I not lament in separation and forment?","The stick also says, I was once a green branch; that cavalcade broke and fore to pieces my saddle.","We are exiles in separation; O kings, give ear to us — To God is the returning.","From God in the first place we sprang in the world; to Him likewise we revert from the revolution.","Our cry is like the bell in the caravan, or as thunder when the clouds travel the sky.","Wayfarer, set not your heart upon a lodging-place, becoming weary at the time of attraction; For you have departed from many a stage, from the sperm until the season of youth.","Take it lightly, that you may escape easily; give up readily, and so find the reward.","io Take hold of Him firmly, for He has taken firm hold on you; first He and last He — go, discover Him.","Gendy He draws the bow, for that arrow of His quivers in the hearts of the lovers.","Be the lover Turk or Greek or Arab, this cry right enough is fellow-tongue with him.","The wind is lamenting and calling to you, Come in my wake, even to the river of water.","I was water; I became wind; I have come to deliver the thirsty ones from this mirage.","Speech is that wind which was formerly water; it becomes water when it casts off the veil.","This shout arose from without the six directions: Flee from direction, and turn not your face from Us.","O lover, you are not less than the moth; when does the moth ever avoid the flame?","The King is in the city; for the sake of the owl how should I abandon the city and occupy the ruin?","If an ass has gone mad, strike the ox-whip upon its head until its senses return.","If I seek his heart, his worthlessness increases still more; God said regarding the unbelievers, Strike their necks.","That moon has returned, whose like the sky never saw even in dreams; he has brought a fire which no water can extinguish Behold the body’s tenement, and behold my soul — Love’s cup has intoxicated the one and ruined the other.","When the master of the tavern became my heart’s companion, my blood turned to wine out of love, my heart to roast.","When the eye is filled with his image, a voice proclaims, Well done, goblet, and bravo, wine!","My heart suddenly descried the ocean of Love; it leaped away from me, saying, Come, find me now!","The sun of the countenance of Shams-i Din, Pride of Tabriz — in its track like clouds all hearts are running.","You who possess not Love, it is lawful to you — sleep on; be gone, for Love and Love’s sorrow is our portion — sleep on.","We have become motes of the sun of sorrow for the Beloved; you in whose heart this passion has never arisen, sleep on.","In endless quest of union with Him we hurry like a river; you who are not anguished by the question Where is He?","— sleep on.","Love’s path is outside the two and seventy sects; since your love and way is mere trickery and hypocrisy, sleep on.","His dawn-cup is our sunrise, his crepuscule our supper; you whose yearning is for viands and whose passion is for supper, sleep on.","In quest of the philosopher’s stone we are melting like copper; you whose philosopher’s stone is the bolster and the bedfellow, sleep on.","Like a drunkard you are falling and rising on every side, for night is past and now is the time for prayer; sleep on.","Since fate has barred slumber to me, young man, be gone; for sleep has passed you by and you can now fulfil slumber; sleep on.","We have fallen into Love’s hand — what will Love do?","Since you are in your own hand, depart to the right hand — sleep on.","io I am the one who drinks blood; my soul, you are the one who eats viands; since viands for a certainty demand slumber, sleep on.","I have abandoned hope for my brain and my head too; you aspire to a fresh and juicy brain — sleep on.","I have rent the garment of speech and let words go; you, who are not naked, possess a robe — sleep on.","Since midnight sickness has manifested itself in that Master; till daybreak he has been beating his head uncontrollably against our wall.","Heaven and earth weep and lament because of his lamentation; his breaths have become fiery — you might say he is a fire-temple.","He has a strange sickness — no headache, no feverish pain — no remedy is to be found for it on earth, for it came upon him out of heaven.","When Galen beheld him he took his pulse; and he said, Let go my hand and examine my heart; my pain is beyond the rules.","He suffers neither from yellow nor black bile, neither colic nor dropsy; a hundred tumults have arisen in every corner of our city because of this untoward happening.","He neither eats nor sleeps; he receives his nourishment from Love, for this Love is now both nurse and mother to the Master.","I said, O God, grant compassion, that he may find rest for a brief hour; he has spilled no man’s blood, he has seized no man’s property.","The answer came from heaven, Let him be as he is, for medicine and remedy are useless in lovers’ suffering.","Seek no cure for this Master; do not bind him, do not counsel him, for where he has fallen is neither transgression nor piety.","When did you ever see Love?","You have never heard from lovers; keep silent, chant no spells; this is not a case for magic or jugglery!","Come, Shams-i Tabriz!, source of light and radiance, for this illustrious spirit without your splendour is frozen and congealed.","I have come so that, tugging your ear, I may draw you to me, unheart and unself you, plant you in my heart and soul.","Rosebush, I have come a sweet springtide unto you, to seize you very gently in my embrace and squeeze you.","I have come to adorn you in this worldly abode, to convey you above the skies like lovers’ prayers.","I have come because you stole a kiss from an idol fair; give it back with a glad heart, master, for I will seize you back.","What is a mere rose?","You are the All, you are the speaker of the command Say.","If no one else knows you, since you are I, I know you.","You are my soul and spirit, you are my Fatiha- chanter; become altogether the Fatiha, so that I may chant you in my heart.","You are my quarry and game, though you have sprung from the snare; return back to the snare, and if you go not, I will drive you.","The lion said to me, You are a wondrous deer; be gone!","Why do you run in my wake so swiftly?","I will tear you to pieces.","Accept my blow, and advance forward like a hero’s shield; give your ear to naught but the bowstring, that I may bend you like a bow.","So many thousand stages there are from earth’s bounds to man; I have brought you from city to city, I will not leave you by the roadside.","Say nothing, froth not, do not raise the lid of the cauldron; simmer well, and be patient, for I am cooking you.","No, for you are a lion’s whelp hidden in a deer’s body: I will cause you suddenly to transcend the deer’s veil.","You are my ball, and you run in the curved mallet of my decree; though I am making you to run, I am still running in your track.","Come, come, for the rosebower has blossomed; come, come, for the beloved has arrived.","Bring at once altogether soul and world; deliver over to the sun, for the sun has drawn a fine blade.","Laugh at that ugly one showing off airs; weep for that friend who is severed from the Friend.","The whole city seethed when the rumour ran abroad that the madman had once again escaped from his chains.","What day is it, what day is it, such a day of uprising?","— Perchance the scroll of men’s deeds has already fluttered from the skies.","Beat the drums, and speak no more; what place is there for heart and mind?","For the soul too has fled.","This house wherein continually rings the sound of the bellstaff — ask of the master what house this house is.","What is this idol -form, if it is the house of the Kaaba?","And what is this light of God, if it is the Magian temple?","In this house is a treasure which the whole of being cannot contain; this house and this master are all a fiction and a pretence.","Lay not hand upon this house, for this house is a talisman; speak not to the master, for he is drunk since last night.","The dust and rubbish of this house is all ambergris and musk; the noise of the door of this house is all verse and melody.","In short, whoever enters this house has found a way to the King of the world, the Solomon of the time.","Master, bend down your head once from this roof, for in your fair face is the token of fortune.","I swear by your life that, but for beholding your countenance, though it be the kingdom of the earth, all is mere fantasy and fable.","The garden is baffled as to which is the leaf, which the blossom; the birds are distraught as to which is the snare, which the bait.","This is the Master of heaven, who is like unto Venus and the moon, and this is the house of Love, which is without bound and end.","The soul, like a mirror, has received your image in its heart; the heart has sunk like a comb into the tip of your tress.","Since in Joseph’s presence the women cut their hands, come to me, my soul, for the Soul is there in the midst.","The whole household is drunk, and nobody is aware who enters the threshold, whether it be X or Y.","It is inauspicious; do not sit on the threshold, enter the house at once; he whose place is the threshold keeps all in darkness.","Though God’s drunkards are thousands, yet they are one; the drunkards of lust are all double and treble.","Enter the lions’ thicket and do not be anxious for the wounding, for the anxiety of fear is the figments of women; For there no wounding is, there all is mercy and love, but your imagination is like a bolt behind the door.","Set not fire to the thicket, and keep silence, my heart; draw in your tongue, for your tongue is a flame.","Come, for today is for us a day of festival; henceforward joy and pleasure are on the increase.","Clap hands, say, Today is all happiness; from the beginning it was manifestly a fine day.","Who is there in this world like our Friend?","Who has seen such a festival in a hundred cycles?","Earth and heaven are filled with sugar; in every direction sugarcane has sprouted.","The roar of that pearl-scattering sea has arrived; the world is full of waves, and the sea is invisible.","Muhammad has returned from the Ascension; Jesus has arrived from the fourth heaven.","Every coin which is not of this place is counterfeit; every wine which is not of the cup of the Soul is impure.","What a splendid assembly, where the saki is good fortune, and his companions are Junaid and Ba Yazld!","Crop-sickness afflicted me when I was desirous; I did not know that God Elimself desires us.","Now I have fallen asleep and stretched out my feet, since I have realised that good fortune has drawn me on.","In this river the heart is like a ruined waterwheel; in whichever direction it turns, there is water before it; And even if you turn your back to the water, the water runs hurrying before you.","Flow shall the shadow save its soul from the sun, seeing that its soul is in the hand of the sun?","If the shadow stretches forth its neck, the sun’s face that instant is shrouded.","Brave Sun, before which this sun in heaven quivers with fear like quicksilver!","The moon is like quicksilver on a palsied palm — one night only, and for the rest it is poured forth; In every thirty nights, two nights it is united and lean, for the rest it endures separation, and separation is forture.","Though it is wretched, it is fresh of face; laughter is the habit and wont oflovers.","It lives laughing, and likewise dies laughing, for its return is to laughing fortune.","Keep silent, for the faults of vision always come from question and answer.","So long as the form of the Beloved’s image is with us, for us the whole of life is a joyful parade.","Where friends unite together, there in the midst of the house, by Allah, is a spreading plain; And where the heart’s desire comes true, there one thorn is better than a thousand dates.","When we are sleeping at the head of the Beloved’s lane, our pillow and blankets are the Pleiades; When we are twisted into the tip of the Beloved’s tress on the Night of Power, power belongs to us.","When the reflexion of His beauty shines forth, mountainland and earth are silk and brocade.","When we ask of the breeze the scent of Him, in the breeze is the echo of lute and reedpipe.","When we write His name in the dust, every particle of dust is a dark-eyed houri.","We chant a spell of Him over the fire; thereby the raging fire becomes water-cool.","Why shall I tell a long tale?","For when we mention His name to nonbeing too, it increases being.","That subtlety in which Love is contained is fuller of pith than a thousand walnuts.","That instant when Love showed its face, all these things vanished from the midst.","Silence!","For the sealing has been completed; the totality of desire is God Most High.","Today a new madness has arrived, it has dragged the chains of a thousand hearts; Today it has rent the sides of the bags of white sugar candy.","Again that bedouin has purchased the Joseph of beauty for eighteen base pieces.","All night the souls in glory and felicity pastured amidst narcissus and jasmine, Until with the dawn of course every spirit leaped forth nimble and sprightly.","Today narcissus-bed and anemone have blossomed out of stones and clods, The tree has bloomed in the midst of winter, in January the fruits have ripened.","You might say that God has created a new world in this ancient world.","Lover-gnostic, recite this ode, for Love has chosen you out of all the lovers.","On your golden cheek there is a toothmarlc — has that silverybreasted one perchance bitten you?","It is right that He should cherish that heart which has throbbed much in anguish for Him.","Silence!","Go sauntering through the meadow for today it is the turn for the eyes to behold.","Which is the road by which I came?","I would return, for it likes me not here; One moment’s absence from the Beloved’s lane is unlawful according to the doctrine of lovers.","If only in all the village there is someone — by Allah, a sign would be completely sufficient.","How shall the finch escape?","For even the simurgh is footfast in this stout snare.","My heart, do not come wandering in this direction; sit there, for it is a pleasant station.","Choose that dessert which augments life, seek that wine which is full-bodied; The rest is all scent and image and colour, the rest is all war and shame and opprobrium; Be silent, and sit down, for you are drunk, and this is the edge of the roof.","Be gathered together, comrades, for this is not the time to sleep; by Allah, every comrade who sleeps is not of the true companions.","Whoever is not turning about and weeping after the fashion of a waterwheel shall not see the face of the garden, he will lose the way to the garden.","You who have sought the heart’s desire in the world of water and clay, you are running towards that river in which there is no water.","O moon, come forth from the heart’s sky and turn our night to day, that no night-traveller may say, Tonight is not a night of moonshine.","May my heart be unapprised of where the Beloved is, if my heart is not quivering like the heart of quicksilver for the love of Him.","Love resides not in science and learning, scrolls and pages; whatever men chatter about, that way is not the lovers’ way.","Know that the branch of Love is in pre-eternity and its roots in post-eternity; this tree rests not upon heaven and earth, upon legs.","We have deposed reason and circumscribed passion, for such majesty is not appropriate to this reason and these habits.","So long as you are desirous, know that this desire of yours is an idol; when you have become beloved, after that there is no existence for the desirous.","The mariner is always upon the planks of fear and hope; once planks and mariner have passed away, nothing remains but drowning.","Shams-i Tabriz!, you are at once sea and pearl, for your being entirely is naught but the secret of the Creator.","Mind you do not slip, for the road behind and ahead is wet with blood; man-robbers are nowadays more numerous than gold-robbers.","If they are intent on robbing people of reason and awareness, what then will they make of him who is unaware of himself?","Do not consider yourself’s self so worthless and without antagonist; the world is in quest of gold, and your self is the mine of gold.","The prophet of God said, Men are as mines; the self is a mine of silver and gold and is truly full of gems.","You find a treasure, and therein you find not life for all the treasure; discover yourself, for this worldly treasure passes away from you.","Discover yourself, and be wary; yet what are you to do?","For there is a wakeful, quickhanded thief on this way.","Though the dawn is dark, day is to be reckoned at hand; whoever’s lace is turned towards the sun is as the dawn.","The spirits become intoxicated through the breath of daybreak, inasmuch as the face of daybreak is towards the sun and is the companion of vision.","You fling down the counter so many times upon haply and perchance, for you are very bankrupt, and heaven’s wheel carries off everything.","io Brain-sieved and aware of nothing, you have fallen asleep — one might say your morsel of daily bread is the brain of an ass.","Labour more, and collect gold, and be joyful, for all your silver and gold and wealth is the serpent of hell.","For God’s sake, live one night without eating and sleeping; a hundred nights because of lust your carnal soul is sleepless and foodless.","Out of agony and grief, from behind every atom of dust comes sighing and lamentation, but your ear is deaf.","Sprinkle the heart’s blood on your cheek at dawn, for your provision for the way is heart’s blood and the sigh of morn.","Fill your heart with hope, and polish it well and clear, for your pure heart is the mirror of the sun of splendour.","Say, who is the companion of Ahmad the Aposde in this world?","Shams-i Tabriz the Emperor, who is one of the greatest things.","Lias perchance this instant the tip of that tress become scattered?","For such a Tartar musk has become amber-diffusing.","Lias perchance the dawn breeze lifted the veil from Flis face?","For thousands of unseen moons have begun to shine.","Is there any soul which is not happy through Flis sweet perfume?","Though the soul has no clue as to the source of its happiness.","Many a happy rose is laughing through the breath of God, yet every soul does not know whence it has become laughing.","Flow fairly the sun of Flis cheek has shone today, through which thousands of hearts have become rubies of Badakhshan.","Yet why should not the lover set his heart upon Him through whose grace the body has become wholly soul?","Did the heart perchance one morning behold Him as He is, so that from that vision of Him it has today become after this wise?","Ever since the heart beheld that peri-born beauty of mine, it has taken the glass into its hand and become an exorcist.","If His sweet breeze blows upon the tree of the body, how a-tremble two hundred leaves and two hundred branches have become!","If there is not an immortal soul for every one slain by Him, why has it become so easy for the lover to yield up his soul?","Even the aware ones are unaware of His life and activities, for His life and activities have become their veil.","If the minstrel of Love has not breathed upon the reed of a heart, why has every tip of the hair become lamenting like the reed pipe?","If Shams-i Tabriz does not fling clods from the roof against the heart, then why have the souls become as it were his doorkeepers?","He said, Who is at the door?","I said, Your humble slave.","He said, What is your business?","I said, Lord, to greet you.","He said, How long will you drive?","I said, Until you call.","He said, How long will you boil?","I said, Till the resurrection.","I laid claim to love, I swore many oaths that for love’s sake I had lost kingship and nobility.","He said, For a claim the cadi requires witness.","I said, My witness is my tears, my sign the pallor of my cheeks.","He said, Your witness is invalid; your eye is wet-skirted.","I said, By the splendour of your justice, they are just and without fault.","He said, Who was your companion?","I said, Your fantasy, O King.","He said, Who summoned you hither?","I said, The scent of your cup.","He said, What is your intention?","I said, Fidelity and friendship.","He said, What do you desire of me?","I said, Your universal grace.","He said, Where is it most agreeable?","I said, Caesar’s palace.","He said, What did you see there?","I said, A hundred miracles.","He said, Why is it desolate?","I said, For fear of the highwayman.","He said, Who is the highwayman?","I said, This blame.","He said, Where is safety?","I said, In abstinence and godliness.","He said, What is abstinence?","I said, The way of salvation.","He said, Where is calamity?","I said, In the street of your love.","He said, How fare you there?","I said, In perfect rectitude.","Silence!","For if I were to utter his subtleties you would come forth from yourself, neither door nor roof would remain to you.","Show your face, for the orchard and rosegarden are my desire; open your lips, for abundant sugar is my desire.","Sun of beauty, come forth one moment out of the cloud, for that glittering, glowing countenance is my desire.","Out of your air I heard the sound of the falcon-drum; I returned, for the sultan’s forearm is my desire.","You said capriciously, Trouble me no more; be gone!","That saying of yours, Trouble me no more, is my desire, And your repulse, Be gone, the king is not at home, and those mighty airs and brusqueness of the doorkeeper, are my desire.","In the hand of every one who exists there are filings of beauty; that quarry of elegance and that mine are my desire.","This bread and water of heaven’s wheel are like a treacherous forrent; I am a fish, a leviathan, Oman is my desire.","Like Jacob I am crying alas, alas; the fair visage of Joseph of Canaan is my desire","By Allah, without you the city is a prison for me; I wander abroad, mountain and desert are my desire, io My heart is weary of these weak-spirited fellow-travellers; the Lion of God and Rustam-i Dastan are my desire.","My soul is sick of Pharaoh and his tyranny; that light of the countenance of Moses son of ‘Imran is my desire.","I am aweary of these tearful people so full of complaining; that ranting and roaring of the drunkards is my desire.","I am more eloquent than the nightingale, but because of vulgar envy a seal is on my tongue, and lamentation is my desire.","Last night the shaikh went all about the city, lamp in hand, crying, I am weary of beast and devil, a man is my desire.","They said, He is not to be found, we too have searched.","He answered, He who is not to be found is my desire.","Though I am penniless, I will not accept a small carnelian, for that rare, precious carnelian is my desire.","Hidden from every eye, and all things seen are from Him — that hidden One manifest in works is my desire.","My state has gone beyond every desire and yearning; from mine and place to the elements is my desire.","My ear heard the tale of faith and became drunk; where is the portion of sight?","The form of faith is my desire.","In one hand the winecup, in the other the Beloved’s curl — to dance so in the midst of the arena is my desire.","That rebeck says, I am dead of expectation; the hand and bosom and plectrum of ‘Uthman are my desire.","I am at once Love’s rebeck, and Love is my rebeck-player; those favours of the plucking of the All-merciful are my desire.","Cunning minstrel, number the rest of this ode after this fashion, for it is after this fashion I desire.","Show your face from the east, Sun of the Pride of Tabriz; I am the hoopoe, the presence of Solomon is my desire.","Though from left and right there is useless criticism and vilification, that man who has lost his heart turns not away from Love.","The moon scatters light, and the dog barks at it; what harm does that do to the moon?","Such is a dog’s speciality.","The lover is a mountain, not a straw to be blown away by the wind; it is a flock of flies that the wind has waylaid.","If it is the rule that blame should arise from Love, it is also the rule for Love to be deaf to it.","Desolation of both worlds on this road is true cultivation; to eschew all benefits is a benefit in Love.","Jesus from the fourth sphere calls, Welcome!","Wash your hands and mouth, for now is the time for the Table.","Go, become effaced in the Friend in the tavern of not-being; wherever two drunkards are together, there is bound to be a brawl.","You enter the devil’s court crying, Justice, justice!","Seek justice from God, for here is nothing but wild beasts.","The Prophet said, Take not counsel from a woman; this carnal soul of ours is a woman, even though it be an abstinent, io Drink so much wine that you cease to chatter; after all, are you not a lover?","And is not this love a tavern?","Though you should utter verse and prose like Ja‘fari gold, there where Ja‘far is it is all worthless tales.","My soul, spiritual beauty is passing fair and glorious, yet your own beauty and loveliness is something beside.","You who spend years describing spirit, show one quality that is equal to his essence.","Through his phantasm the light of the eye increases, yet for all that in the presence of union with him it is clouded.","I stand open-mouthed in reverence for that beauty; every moment God is greater is on my tongue and in my heart.","The heart has acquired an eye constant in desire of you; ah, how that desire nourishes the heart and eye!","Speak not of houris and moon, spirit and peri, for these resemble Him not; He is something other.","Slave-caressing it is that your love has practised, else where is the heart that is worthy of that love?","Every heart that has been sleepless for one night in desire for you is bright as day, and the air by it is illumined.","Every one who has become without object is as your disciple; his object is realized without the form of object.","io Every limb of hell who has burned and fallen into this love, has fallen into Kauthar, for your love is Kauthar.","My foot does not reach the ground out of hope for union, withal through separation from you my hand is on my head.","My heart, be not sorrowful at this oppression of foes, and meditate on this, that the Sweetheart is judge.","If my enemy is glad because of my saffron-pale face, is not my saffron-pale face derived from the red rose?","Since my Beloved’s beauty surpasses description, how fat is my grief, and how lean my praise!","Yes, since it is the rule that the more the pain of the wretched sufferer is, the less is his lament.","Shams-i Din shone moonlike from Tabriz; no, what is the moon indeed?","That face outshines the moon.","That spirit which wears not true love as a garment is better not to have been; its being is nothing but a disgrace.","Be drunk in love, for love is all that exists; without the commerce of love there is no admittance to the Beloved.","They say, What is love?","Say, The abandonment of free will.","He who has not escaped out of free will, no free will has he.","The lover is an emperor; the two worlds are scattered over him; the king pays no heed to the scattering.","Love it is and the lover that remain till all eternity; set not your heart on aught but this, for it is merely borrowed.","How long will you embrace a dead beloved?","Embrace the soul which naught embraces.","What was born of spring dies in the season of autumn; love’s rosebower receives no replenishment from spring.","The rose that comes of spring, the thorn is its companion; the wine that comes of pressed grapes is not exempt from cropsickness.","Be not an expectant spectator on this path; for by Allah, there is no death worse than expectancy, io Set your heart on the true coin, if you are not counterfeit; give ear to this subtlety, if you lack an earring.","Tremble not on the body’s steed; fare lighter afoot; God gives wings to him who rides not on the body.","Let go care and become wholly clear of heart, like the face of a mirror without image and picture — When it has become clear of images, all images are contained in it; that clear-faced one is not ashamed of any man’s lace.","Would you have your self clear of blemish?","Gaze upon Him, for He is not ashamed or afraid of the truth.","Since the steely face gained this skill from purity, what shall the heart’s face, which is without dust, discover?","I said, What shall it discover?","No, I will not say; silence is better, lest the heart-ravisher should say, He cannot keep a secret.","Every moment the voice of Love is arriving from left and right; we are departing for the skies — who has a mind for sightseeing?","We were once in heaven, we were friends of the angels; let us all return thither, for that is our city.","We are even higher than the heavens, we are greater than angels; why should we not transcend both?","Our lodging-place is Majesty.","How tar is the world of dust from the pure substance!","Upon what have you alighted?","Load up — what place is this?","Young luck is our friend, to yield up the soul is our business; the leader of our caravan is Mustafa, Pride of the World.","At his moon the moon was split, it could not endure to behold him; the moon attained such luck — she, a humble beggar.","The sweet scent of the breeze is from the curl of his tress, the glitter of this phantasm is from that cheek like the forenoon.","Behold in our hearts every moment a splitting of the moon, for why does your eye soar beyond the vision of that vision?","Mankind, like waterfowl, are sprung from the sea of the soul; how should the bird that has risen from that sea make its dwelling here?","Nay rather, we are pearls in that sea, we are all present therein; else, why does wave upon wave surge from the sea of the heart?","The wave of Alast came along and caulked the body’s ship; when the ship is wrecked once more, the turn of union and encounter will come.","My being is but a goblet in the Beloved’s hand — look at my eyes, if you do not believe it.","I am like a goblet, heart full of blood and body slender, in the hand of Love, which is neither pale nor lean nor slender.","This Love consumes nothing but Moslem blood; come, I will tell it in your ear — amazing, it is not an infidel.","A thousand forms like Adam and Eve are born; the world is full of His image, but He is not endowed with form.","He knows what is salutary for the desert sand-grain and the drop of the ocean, and brings replenishment, for His knowledge is not deaf.","Every moment He binds and releases our hearts; why should the heart not know Him by His actions, if it is not an ass?","Through being bound and released by the hand of the assdriver the ass has become a gnostic, and knows that he is, and none beside; Seeing him, it moves its head and ear assishly; it recognises his call, for it is not disguised.","From his hand it has consumed sweet provender and water — amazing!","Do you not receive such provision from God?","A thousand times He has fettered you in pain, and you have cried out; why do you disapprove?","God is not constrained to release you.","Like the infidel you bow your head only in time of affliction; not worth half a grain is the head that belongs not yonder.","A thousand spiritual forms are flying in the air like Ja‘far-i Taiyar, although they are not Ja‘far; But how should the cage-bird know about the air?","It supposes gloomily, I have no wings.","Every moment it puts its head out of the fissure of the cage; there is room for its head, but not its body, for the head is not the whole","The fissure of your five senses is the fissure of that cage; you see a thousand prospects, but there is no way to the prospect.","Your body is dry tinder, and that vision is fire; when you look well into the matter, all is nothing but flame.","Not tinder is it, for it has become fire in burning; know that the tinder is light, although it is not shining.","For the sake of the ears of those who shall come after me I speak and set down; our life is not postponed; For Love has seized them by the ear and is bringing them by secret ways where reason is no guide.","Muhammad’s eye has closed in sleep, and the rebeck has become feeble; sleep not — these words are a treasure of gold, even if they are not gold in truth.","Mankind are stars, and Shams-i Tabriz!","is the sun; which star is there that is not illumined by his sun?","What pearl are you?","For in no man’s hand is the price of you.","What does the world possess that is not your gift?","Is there a worse punishment than his who lives exiled from your face?","Do not punish your servant, for all that he is unworthy of you.","Every moment I would scatter my heart and soul in your dust; dust be on the head of the soul that is not the dust of your feet!","Blessed to all birds is your air; how unblest is the bird that is not in your air!","Amidst the billows of contingencies even the master shall not escape by swimming, if he is not familiar with you.","The world has no permanence, and if it has, count it as perishing, since it is not intimate with your permanence.","How happy is the king that is mated by your rook!","How lair of presence is he who is never without your presence!","I will not flee from your blow, for very raw indeed is the heart that is not roasted in the fire of your trial.","The heart that has not been naughted turns its face to place; from placelessness you drive it, saying, Begone!","This is no place for you.","io There is no end to your praise and praisers; what atom is there that is not reeling with your praise?","As Nizami expresses it in verse, Tyrannise not, for I cannot endure your tyranny.","Three days it is now since my fair one has become changed; sugar is never bitter — how is it that that sugar is sour?","I dipped my pitcher into the fountain that contained the Water of Life, and I saw that the fountain was full of blood.","In the garden where two hundred thousand roses grew, in place of fruit and blossom there are thorns and stones and desert.","I chant a spell and whisper it over the face of that peri — for incantation is always the business of the exorcist — Yet for all my incantations my peri came not back into the bottle, since his activities transcend chants and spells.","Between his brow there are ancient angers; the frown on the brow of Laila is destruction to Majnun.","Come, come, for without you I have no life; see, see, for without you my eyes are a veritable flood.","By the right of your moonlike countenance, brighten my eye, though my sins are greater than the whole of mankind’s.","My heart turns about itself, saying, What is my sin?","For every cause is conjoined with a consequence.","A proclamation comes to me from the Marshal of eternal judgment: Seek not about your own self,

paradise opens its gate which is ungrudging.","Of the essence of the thorn you behold marvellous flowers; of the essence of the stone you see the treasure of Korah.","Divine grace is eternal, and thereof a thousand keys lie hidden between the kdf and the ship of the nun.","Love is nothing but felicity and lovingkindness, it is nothing but gladness and right guidance.","Bu Hanifa did not teach love, Shaffi had no tradition concerning it.","Licit and illicit operate till death; there is no terminus to the science of lovers.","Lovers are drowned in sugar-water; Egypt has nothing to complain about sugar.","How should the drunkard’s soul not utter thanks for a wine to which there is no boundary and limit?","Whomsoever you have seen sorrowful and scowling is not a lover, and belongs not to that province; Otherwise, every bud is a veil of a garden, jealousy and envy have no contagion.","The beginner in this path of Love is he who is not apprised of beginning.","Become naughted from selfhood, because there is no sin worse than being.","io Do not be a shepherd, be a flock; shepherdry is nothing but a bar to providential care.","God is sufficient for many a servant’s ill, but the servant has not this knowledge and sufficiency.","He says, This is problematic and allegorical; this is clear, this is not allegory.","A blind man struck his foot against a pitcher; he said, The doorkeeper is not careful.","What are pitchers and glasses doing on the footpath?","The road is not clear of these pots.","Remove the pitchers from the path; the doorkeeper is not attending to his job.","The doorkeeper answered, Blind man, no pitcher is on the path, the fact is that you have no knowledge of the path.","You have left the path and are going to the pitcher; that is plain error.","Master, your drunkenness in the way of religion is the only sign from beginning to end.","You are a sign, and a seeker after a sign; there is no better sign than the seeker after a sign.","You are astray from the path, otherwise in the path of striving no striver goes without his wages.","Just as an atom’s weight he shall see it, an atom’s weight of slipping goes not unpunished; An atom of good is not without a reward — open your eyes, if you are not blind.","Every herb is a token of water; what is there that is not tributary to that?","Enough, this water has many tokens; the thirsty man requires no counselling.","The bird of my heart has again begun to flutter, the parrot of my soul has begun to chew sugar.","My mad and drunken camel has begun to rend the chain of reason.","A gulp of that incautious wine has begun to flow over my head and eyes.","The lion of the gaze, despite the dog of the Companions of the Cave, has begun to drink my blood again.","The water is flowing again in this river; by the riverbanlc the grass has begun to shoot.","The dawn breeze is blowing again in the garden, it has begun to blow over rose and rosebed.","Love sold me for a single fault; Love’s heart burned, and has begun to buy back.","He drove me away; compassion came to him and called; Love has begun to look kindly upon me.","My enemy has seen that I am with the Friend; he has begun to gnaw his hand of envy.","My heart has escaped from the trickery of fortune, it has begun to creep into Love’s bosom.","The tale-bearer brow making hints has begun to curve over that eye.","When Love called my heart towards Him, my heart began to flee from all creation.","Creatures are sticks; the blind man flings away the stick when he begins to see."," Creatures are like milk; the infant turns from milk when it has begun to digest viands.","The spirit is like a falcon taking wing, for it has begun to hear the drum of the king.","Enough, for the veil of speech has begun to spin a curtain around you.","The hour is late, the hour is late, the sun has gone down into the well, the sun of the soul of lovers has entered the seclusion of God.","A day is hidden in night, a Turk is amongst Hindus; night, launch your assaults, for that Turk is in the tent.","If you catch a glimpse of this brightness, you will set sleep afire; for by night-faring and servitude Venus became the companion of the moon.","We are fleeing by night and running apace, and the Zangis are on our track, for we carried off the gold, and the watchman became aware.","We have learned nightfaring and consumed a hundred watchmen; our cheeks are lit up like candles because that pawn of ours has become king.","Happy indeed is that smiling one who has pressed cheek against that cheek!","Great and glorious is that heart which has departed unto that Sweetheart!","Who is there on the path of the heart who has not a sigh in his heart?","That man is truly successful who is drowned in that sigh.","When he is drowned in the sea, the sea carries him up to the surface, like Joseph of the well who emerged from the well to greatness.","They say, Man’s origin is the dust, and he returns to the dust.","How should he become dust who is the dust of this doorway?","The crops appear all of one kind until the harvest-time arrives; one half of it has become fine grain, the other half is chaff.","Fair ones, fair ones, a fair one has gone mad; his bowl has fallen from our roof, he has gone to the madhouse.","He circled about the pool like men athirst seeking and searching; suddenly like a dry crust he became a sop in our pool.","Learned man, stop up your ears against this; do not listen to this incantation, for he has become a legend through our charm.","The ears do not escape from this ring which has robbed minds of their reason; having laid his head on the millstone, he vanished like a grain into the measure.","Regard it not as a sport, regard it not as a sport; here choose gambling away life; heads in plenty through love of his curls have become turned upside down like a comb.","Be not puffed up by your reason; many a well-trusted master who was a pillar of the world has become more lamenting than the Moaning Pillar.","I, who have cut away from life, roselike have rent my robe, thence have become such that my reason has become a stranger to my soul.","Those drops of individual reason have become vanquished in the Sea of Reason; the atoms of these fragmentary souls have become annihilated in the Beloved.","I will keep silent, I will perform the command and hide this candle — a candle in whose light the sun and the moon are moths.","Who is that, who is that who makes the breast sorrowful, then when you make complaint before Him, He turns your bitter sweet?","First He appears as a deaf adder, lastly He is a treasure of pearls.","Sweet King, who in a moment transforms that bitterness to goodness!","Let it be a demon, He makes it into a houri, let it be a funeral, He makes it into a marriage -feast; and He makes knowing and world-beholding one blind from his mother’s womb.","He makes the dark bright, He makes the thorn into a rosebud; He draws the thorn out of your palm, and fashions you a pillow of roses.","For the sake of Abraham His friend He causes the fire to flame, and converts Nimrod’s furnace into blossoms and eglantine.","He who gives light to the stars and succour to the helpless, He benefits His servant, and too applauds His servant.","He causes all the sins of the sinners to scatter like December leaves; into the ears of those who speak Him ill He recites forgiveness of sin.","He says, Say, O Faithful One, pardon the sin of one who slipped; when a servant enters upon prayer, He secretly says Amen.","It is His amen which gives a man joy in his prayer; like a fig, He is inwardly and outwardly alike sweet and pleasant.","It is rapture which in good and evil gives strength to hand and foot, for this rapture mates the strength of a Rustam to the body of a poor wretch.","With rapture the poor wretch is a Rustam, without rapture Rustam is one full of grief; but for rapture, how would the Friend of the Soul stablish the soul?","I sent forth my heart timely (for it knows swiftly to travel the way), to carry the description of Shams-i Din to the Tabriz of fidelity.","Advice from anyone is never of profit to lovers; love is not the kind of forrent that anyone can dam up.","No man of intellect will ever know the head’s ecstasy of the drunkard; no man of reason will ever know the heart’s rapture of the reason-lost.","Kings would become indifferent to kingship if they caught a whiff of those wines which lovers drink in the heart’s assembly.","Khusrau bids farewell to his kingdom for the sake of Shinn; Farhad too for her sake strikes the axe against the mountain.","Majnun flees from the circle of men of intellect for love of Laila; Vamiq laughed at the mustachios of every puffed-up man.","Frozen is the life that has passed without that sweet spirit; rotten is the kernel that is oblivious of this almond-cake.","If yonder heaven were not spinning bewildered and in love like us, it would grow weary of its revolving, and say, It is enough for me; how long, how long?","The world is like a reed pipe, and He blows in its every hole; truly its every lament derives from those two sugarsweet lips.","Behold how, when He blows into every clod, every heart, He bestows a need, He bestows a passion which raises lamentation of anguish.","io If you tear the heart away from God, to whom will you then commit it?","Tell me this.","Soulless is the person who has been able to tear his heart away from God for a single moment.","I will make enough; go you nimbly, by night climb on to this roof; raise a fair clamour in the city, my soul, with a loud voice!","The springtide of lovers has come, that this dust bowl may become a garden; the proclamation of heaven has come, that the bird of the soul may rise in flight.","The sea becomes full of pearls, the salt marsh becomes sweet as Kauthar, the stone becomes a ruby from the mine, the body becomes wholly soul.","If the eyes and souls of lovers are raining a flood like a cloud, yet the heart within the body’s cloud is flashing like lightning.","Do you know why the lovers’ eyes have become like a cloud in Love?","Because that moon generally is concealed in clouds.","Happy and laughing hour, when those clouds have begun to weep!","Lord, what a blessed state, when those lightnings are laughing!","Of those hundreds of thousands of drops, not one drop falls upon the earth; for if it should fall upon the earth, the whole world would be laid in ruin.","Though the whole world be laid in ruin, yet every desolation through love becomes fellow-mariner with Noah, and so is intimate with the Flood.","Did the flood abate, the heavens would not go round; through that wave beyond direction these six directions keep in motion.","You who remain fast under these six directions, at once sorrow and do not sorrow, for those seeds beneath the ground will one day become a plantation of date-trees.","One day that root will raise its head from the dust, it will become a fresh green branch; what if two or three branches should wither, the rest of the tree will be pregnant with life; And when that dry branch is set afire, the fire will be joyous like the soul; if that is not this, it will become this; if this is not that, it will become that.","Something has closed my mouth, as if to say, What, drunk and on the edge of the roof?","Whatever it may be that bewilders you, that thing is bewildered at Him.","My Beloved leaves me not so much as to scratch my own head; it is the body of my Beloved that presses me in its breast.","Now He draws me in His train like a string of camels, anon the King places me in front like the commander of His troops.","Anon He sucks me like a seal-ring, to plant His seal through me; anon He makes me into a ring and fastens me on His door.","He takes blood and makes a sperm, He takes sperm and fashions a creature; He slays the creature and fashions Reason, He makes manifest the resurrection.","Now He drives me away with a reed like a dove from the house, anon with a hundred entreaties He calls me to His presence","Now He carries me like a ship on a voyage over the sea, anon He halts me and ties me to His own anchor.","Now He makes me water for the sake of the seeker after purity, anon He makes me a thorn in the path of His luckless ones.","The eternal eight paradises did not become the prospect of that King; how happy is this heart of mine, which He makes His prospect!","Not by the attestation of faith did I become a believer in that Beauty of the Soul; only then did I become a believer in It when I became an unbeliever in myself, io Whoever joined His ranks became secure from destruction by Him; I saw the sword in His hand, I burned that shield of mine.","I was like-pinioned with Gabriel, I had six hundred wings; now that I have reached Him, what shall I do with my wings?","Many days and nights I was guardian of the pearl of my soul; now in the current of the ocean of pearls I am indifferent to my own pearl.","How long will you essay to describe Him?","For He comes not within description; make enough, that I may ride over my commotion.","The Friend is toggling me like a camel; in what train is He dragging His drunken camel?","He wounded my soul and body, He broke my glass, He bound my neck — to what task is He drawing me?","His net is carrying me like a fish to the shore; His snare is drawing my heart towards the Master of the chase.","He who makes the train of clouds, like camels under the sky, to water the plain, is drawing me over mountain and cavern.","The thunder beats its drum; particle and whole have become alive; the scent of spring is wafting in the twig’s heart and the marrow of the rose.","He who makes the recesses of the seed to be the cause of the fruit, He is dragging the secret of the tree’s heart up to the gallows.","The grace of springtide breaks the pain of the garden’s cropsickness, even though the cruelty of winter is still drawing towards crop-siclcness.","My heart, be seated near that person who has experience of the heart, go under that tree which bears fresh blossoms.","Go not in every direction as do idlers in this druggists’ market; sit in the shop of someone who has sugar in his shop.","If you have no balance, then every one waylays you; one man adorns a counterfeit coin, and you imagine that he has gold; Cheatingly he sets you by the door, saying, I am coming — do not sit expectant at the door, for that house has two doors.","Do not bring your cup to every pot that seethes, and do not sit there, for every seething pot has within it something else.","Not every reed holds sugar; not every under has an over; not every eye has sight; not every sea holds pearls.","Lament, singing nightingale, because the drunkard’s lament has some effect, some effect even on rocks and stones.","Put aside your head if you have no room, for if the thread is not contained in the eye of the needle that is because it has a head.","This wakeful heart is a lantern; hold it under your skirt; pass away from this wind and air, for the air puts it into commotion.","When you have passed away from the wind you have become a dweller in a fountain, you have become companion to a confederate who pours cooling water on the heart.","When you have water on your heart, you are like a green tree which constantly yields new fruit, and journeys within the Heart.","A fair idol that all the night teaches tricks to Venus and the moon, his two eyes by witchery sew up the two eyes of heaven.","Look out for your hearts, Moslems, for I at all events am so commingled with Him that no heart is commingled with me.","First I was born of His love, finally I gave my heart to Him; when fruit is born of a branch, from that branch it hangs.","I am fleeing from my own shadow, for the light is hidden from the shadow; where shall he rest at last who flees from his shadow?","The tip of His tress is saying, Ha, quick, to the rope-triclc!","The cheek of His candle is saying, Where is the moth, that it may burn?","For the sake of that rope-trick be brave, and become a hoop; fling yourself into the fire, when His candle is kindled.","When you have seen the joy of burning you will no more endure without the flame; even if the water oflife came to you, it would not stir you from the flame.","My heart is like an oyster shell, the Beloved’s phantom is the pearl; now I am no more contained, for this house is filled with Him.","Night split the lip of my soul with the sweetness of His talk; I am surprised at him who says, Truth is bitter.","Mortals’ food comes from without, but the lover’s food is from within; he regurgitates and chews, for the lover is like a camel.","Be swift-faring like a peri, denude yourself of your body; nakedness is not allowed to him who has the mange.","Salah al-Din has come to the chase; all the lions are his quarry; that man is his servant who is free from the two worlds.","Once again the drunkards’ head from drunkenness has come into prostration; has perchance that minstrel of the souls struck up music from the veil?","The reckless gamblers of head and soul once more are rioting; being has departed into annihilation, and annihilation has come into being.","Once more the world is full of the sound of Seraphiel’s trumpet; the trustee of the unseen has become visible, for goods and chattels have come to the soul.","See how the earthy particles have received fresh life; all their earthiness has turned to purity, all their loss become gain.","That world is without colour; yet out of the crucible of the sight, like light, this red and blue have issued from the colourmixing soul.","The body’s portion of this is colour, the soul’s portion is delight; for the cauldron’s portion from the kitchen fire is smoke","Consume, O heart, for so long as you are raw, the scent of the Heart will not come from you; when did you ever know anyone to produce the scent of incense without fire?","The scent is always with the incense, it never departed or returned thither; one man says, It came late, another says, It came early.","The Emperor has not fled from the ranks, only the helmet and armour are a veil; the veil over his moonlike face is a helmet against the blows of mortals.","The month of December has departed, and January too; come, for the spring has come, the earth is green and joyous, the time of the tulips has come.","See how the trees stagger and shake their hands as if drunk!","The zephyr has recited a spell, so that the rosebower cannot rest.","The nenuphar said to the jasmine, See how twisted together I am!","The blossoms said to the meadow, The grace of the Omnipotent has descended.","The violet genuflected when the hyacinth bowed humbly, when the narcissus gave a wink, saying, A time for taking note has come.","What did the tossing willow say, that it became light-headed with drunkenness?","What did that fair-statured cypress behold, that it departed and returned firm of foot?","The painters have taken the brush, with whose hands my soul is intoxicated, for their lovely imageries have lent beauty to the grove.","Thousands of sweet-feathered birds seated on their pulpits are praising and reciting lauds, that the time of divulging has come.","When the soul’s bird says Ya Hu!"," the ringdove replies Where, where?","The former says, Since you have not caught the scent, your portion is waiting.","The roses are bidden to show their hearts; it is not seemly to hide the heart, when the unveiling of the friend of the cave has come.","The rose said to the nightingale, Look at the green lily — though it has a hundred tongues, it is steadfast and keeps its secret.","The nightingale replied, Go forth, be busy disclosing my secret, for this love which I possess is reckless like you.","The plane-tree lowered its face to the vine — Prostrate one, stand up!","The vine answered, This prostrating of mine is not voluntary.","I am pregnant with that draught which smites at the drunkards; my inward is as fire, your outward is mere plane.","The saffron came forth gay, the mark of lovers on its cheek; the rose pitied it and said, Ah, this poor creature, how abject it is!","This encounter reached the ears of the laughing-faced, ruby apple, which said to the rose, It knows not that the Beloved is longsuftering.","When the apple advanced this claim, that I think well of the Lord, to put it to the proof stones rained from every side.","Someone stoned him; if he was a true lover, he laughs; why should not Shinn laugh when pelted by Khusrau?","The throwing of clods by the fair ones is meant for calling the lover; the cruelty of lovers to one another is not a sign of aversion.","If Zulaikha that moment fore Joseph’s shirt and collar, know that it was in sport and play that she unveiled his secret.","The apple absorbs the blow and comes not down, saying, I am happy hanging here, for this honour of being hung on high has come upon me, like Mansur.","I am Mansur hanging from the branch of the gallows of the All-Merciful; such kissing and embracing has come upon me far from the lips of the vile ones.","Ho, kissing is done with; hide your heart like a turnover; within the breast utter secretly the words innumerable.","Today your beauty has another lineament, today your delectable lip has another sweetmeat; Today your ruby rose has sprung from another twig, today your cypress-stature has another loftiness.","Today that moon of yours indeed is not contained in the sky, and that wheel-like die of yours has another expanse; Today I know not from which side the commotion has arisen, I only know that through it the world has another riot.","That lion-overthrowing deer — it is evident in its eyes that outside the two worlds it has another desert.","This mad heart departed; both heart and madness became lost, for it has another madness loftier than this madness.","If he has no foot, the lover will fly on eternal wings, and if he has no head, the lover has other heads.","The sea of the two eyes sought him and became empty; it was not aware that another sea contains that pearl.","In love I turned the two worlds upside down; why did you seek him here?","For he holds another place, io My heart’s today is love, my heart’s tomorrow the Beloved; my heart’s today holds in its heart another tomorrow.","If King Salah al-DIn is hidden, it is no wonder, for out of the jealousy of God every moment he has another master of the harem.","Morn-arising friends, who is there that discovers the dawn, who discovers us dancing in confusion like atoms?","Who has the luck to come to the brink of a river to drink water from that river, and to discover the reflection of the moon?","Who is there that like Jacob from the shirt of Joseph seeks the scent of his son, and instead discovers the light of his eyes?","[ ioi Or athirst like the bedouin casts a bucket into the well, and in the bucket discovers a beauty like an ass-load of sugar?","Or like Moses seeking fire, who seeks out a bush, comes to gather the fire, and discovers a hundred dawns and sunrises?","Jesus leaps into the house to escape from the foe; suddenly from the house he discovers a passage to heaven.","Or like a Soloman he splits a fish, and in the belly of that fish he discovers a ring of gold.","Sword in hand, ‘Umar comes intending to slay the Prophet; he falls into God’s snare, and discovers a kindly regard from fortune.","Or like Adham’s son he drives towards a deer to make the deer his prey, and instead discovers another prey.","Or like a thirsty oyster shell he comes with gaping mouth to take a drop of water into himself, and discovers a pearl within himself.","Or a man foraging who turns towards desolations, and suddenly in a desolation he discovers news of a treasure","Traveller, have done with legends, so that intimate alike and stranger may discover without your exposition the light of Did We not open.","Whoever strides sincerely towards Shams al-Din, though his foot may grow weary, he will discover two wings from Love.","Friend, is sugar sweeter or He who makes the sugar?","Friend, is the moon fairer or He who makes the moon?","Forgo sugars, forgo moons; He knows something other, He makes something other.","In the sea are marvels besides pearls, but none like the Monarch who makes the sea and the pearls.","Besides the water is another water springing from a marvellous waterwheel; without flaw and unsleeping It provides sustenance to the heart.","Without knowledge it is not possible to fashion an image of a bath; how shall be that Knowledge which makes intellect and awareness?","Without knowledge you cannot extract oil from fat; consider then that Knowledge which makes sight from fat.","Souls are distraught, without eating and slumber, on account of the marvellous feast which He makes at the time of dawn.","Happy dawn, when that despair of every moon makes His two hands a belt around my waist!","Yonder sky laughs at the mustachios of that deluded one; that laughingstock makes himself an ass in the train of two or three asses.","io That ass flings himself into gold as if into barley; he is heedless of the King who makes gems of stones.","I have made enough, enough, I have quit exhalation; the rest that Darling will speak, who makes of the ear an eye.","That wandering slave has returned, returned; he has come before You burning and melting like a candle.","Smile upon him, O Soul, like anemone and sugar-candy; do not shut the door, O Soul, for he comes in need.","And even if You close the door, he will submit to Your decree; the servant is all servile need, the king is full of pride and disdain.","Every molten candle has become the brightness of the eye, for he who has suffered melting has become privy to the secret.","If I make a difference between envenomed water from His hand and wine, in the path of the Spirit my spirit has come, by Allah, but insincerely.","How should any animal drink His water of life?","How should the eye which is closed behold His face?","I have abandoned travel, I have come to dwell with the Friend, I have become secure from death because that long life has come.","My heart, since you are in this stream why then do you still seek for water?","How long will you say, Come to the Feast?","The time of prayer has come.","Why must I dance in the glow of His sun?","So that when the mote dances, He may remember me.","Every atom has become pregnant of the glow of His face, every atom of that delight gives birth to a hundred atoms.","Behold, in the mortar, how the body out of love for one fleet of spirit beats and bruises itself to become an atom.","If you are pearl and coral, only become grain-fine here, because in this presence only a mote is becoming.","Behold the pearl of the soul in the oyster shell of the body, how it bites its fingers at the hand of affliction.","When the spirit takes flight from you, this imprisoned essence returns to its origin like a mote — you may call to it, but it will not come.","And though its load be very firm and it digs in blood, though for a whole life it goes in blood, not one hair of it will be defiled.","Its only dwelling place is in the well of Babylon; until the soul becomes a magician, it reposes not in any place.","Tabriz!","If Shams al-Din shines forth from your zodiac, even the cloud will become like the moon, even the moon will wax in brightness.","Every moment the Soul is decaying and growing before you, and how should any man plead with you for the sake of a single soul?","Wherever you set your foot a head springs from the earth; for one head’s sake how should anyone wash his hands of you?","On the day when the soul takes flight in joy at your scent, the soul knows, the soul knows, what scent wafts from the Beloved.","Once your crop-sickness diminishes from the brain, the head raises a hundred laments, every hair is groaning.","I have emptied house, that I may be filled with your furniture; I am waning, that your love may wax and increase.","My soul in the train of Shams al-Haqq-i TabrlzT is scudding like a ship without feet over the sea.","Do not despair, my soul, for hope has manifested itself; the hope of every soul has arrived from the unseen.","Do not despair, though Mary has gone from your hands, for that light which drew Jesus to heaven has come.","Do not despair, my soul, in the darkness of this prison, for that king who redeemed Joseph from prison has come.","Jacob has come forth from the veil of occlusion, Joseph who rent Zulaikha’s veil has come.","You who all through night to dawn have been crying O Lord, mercy has heard that O Lord and has come.","O pain which has grown old, rejoice, for the cure has come; O fastened lock, open, for the key has come.","You who have abstained fasting from the Table on high, break your fast with joy, for the first day of the feast has come.","Keep silence, keep silence, for by virtue of the command Be!","that silence of bewilderment has augmented beyond all speech.","Die now, die now, in this Love die; when you have died in this Love, you will all receive new life.","Die now, die now, and do not fear this death, for you will come forth from this earth and seize the heavens.","Die now, die now, and break away from this carnal soul, for this carnal soul is as a chain and you are as prisoners.","Take an axe to dig through the prison; when you have broken the prison you will all be kings and princes.","Die now, die now before the beauteous King; when you have died before the King, you will all be kings and renowned.","Die now, die now, and come forth from this cloud; when you come forth from this cloud, you will all be radiant full moons.","Be silent, be silent; silence is the sign of death; it is because of life that you are fleeing from the silent one.","The weary ones have all gone; close the door of the house; laugh all in union at aweary reason.","Come forth to the Ascension, since you are of the Prophet’s family; kiss the cheek of the moon, since you are on a high roof.","Since he split the moon, why are you clouds?","Since he is sprightly and neat, why are you good-for-nothing?","Weary ones, why did you depart?","For not like true men on this path did you like Farhad and Shaddad in a moment cleave through the mountain.","Since you are not moon-faced, turn not away from the moon-faced; since you are not in anguish, do not bandage your own heads.","Like that it did happen and like this; so it comes not right; do not know how you are, do not know how many you are!","When you beheld that fountain, why did you not become water?","When you saw that Self, why did you approve your own selves?","Since you are in the mine of sugarcane, why are you sour of face?","Since you are in the Water of Life, why are you dry and withered?","Do not contend so, do not flee from felicity; what possibility of flight is there, seeing that you are in the toils of the lasso?","io You are caught in the lasso from which there is no security; do not writhe, do not writhe, do not scrape against the shuttle.","Like self-sacrificing moths rub against this candle; why are you dedicated to the companion?","Why are you attached to the chain?","Burn at this candle, light up your heart and soul, put on a new body when you have flung away this old one.","Why are you afraid of the fox?","You are of lion stock.","Why are you lame asses, since you are of the loins of the swift horse?","The Friend Himself is coming, the door of felicity is opening, for that friend is the key; you are all locks.","Be silent, for speech has swallowed you down; the purchaser is like a parrot, and you are all sugar-candy.","Since your image dwelt within the house of our breasts, wherever we sit has become like highest paradise.","Those thoughts and imaginings that were as Gog and Magog — each one has become like a houri’s cheek and a doll of China.","That image on account of which men and women all weep, if it was once an evil companion, has now become an excellent companion.","Above all a garden has grown, below all is a treasure — what manner of thing are you, that through you the world has become so?","From that day when we beheld him we augment daily; the thorn that sought him out has become a veritable rosebower.","Every unripe grape has become a ripe grape from the sun and has become full of sugar, and that black stone too through the sun has become a precious ruby.","Many an earth there is that by God’s preference has become a heaven, many a left hand through the palm of divine favour has become a right hand.","If once he was darkness to the heart, now he has become the heart’s window; if once he was a footpad of the faith, now he has become the leader of religion.","If it was the well of calamity that was Joseph’s prison, on account of his coming forth it became the firm cord.","Every particle like the army of God is subject to God’s command; to the servant of God it has proved security, to the infidel it has become as an ambush.","Silence!","For your speech is as the Nile — to the Copts like blood, to the Israelites a pure well.","Silence!","For your speech is a ripe fig, only not every bird of the air is suitable for figs.","At the dawn hour a moon appeared in the sky, came down from the sky and gazed upon me.","Like a hawk which seizes a bird at the time of hunting, that moon snatched me up and ran over the sky.","When I gazed at myself I saw myself no more, because in that moon my body through grace became like the soul.","When I voyaged in soul I saw naught but the moon, so that the secret of the eternal revelation was all disclosed.","The nine spheres of heaven were all absorbed in that moon, the ship of my being was entirely hidden in the sea.","That sea surged, and Reason arose again and cast abroad a voice; thus it happened and so it befell.","That sea foamed, and at every foam-fleck something took form and something was bodied forth.","Every foam-fleck of body which received a sign from that sea melted forthwith and became spirit in that sea.","Without the royal fortune of Shams al-Din of Tabriz one could neither behold the moon nor become the sea.","Birds, who are now parted from your cage, show your faces again and declare where you are.","Your ship has stopped on this water, wrecked; like fishes, lor one instant rise from this water.","Is it that the mould has broken and rejoined that Friend?","Or has the trap slipped out of hand, and you are parted from the prey?","Are you today fuel to that fire of yourselves?","Or has the fire in you died, and are you the light of God?","Has that wind become a pestilence and congealed you?","Or has it become the breeze of the zephyr, wherever you enter?","There is an answer from your souls in every word that proceeds, even though you may not open your mouths to answer.","How many pearls you have broken in the mortar of the days!","That is surmeh {collyrium} to the eyes; pound on, pound on!","You who have been born when you arrived at death, this is a second birth — be born, be born!","Whether you are born Hindu or Turk a second time will become clear on the day when you remove the veil, io And if it be that you have been worthy of Shams al-Haqq of Tabriz, by Allah, you are the high chamberlains of the day of retribution.","Though the whole world be full of thorns, the heart of the lover is wholly a rosebower; And though heaven’s wheel be idle and ineffective, the world of lovers is fully employed.","Let all other men be sorrowful, yet the lover’s soul will be gay and happy and sprightly.","Give to the lover every place where a candle is extinguished, for he is endowed with a hundred thousand lights.","Even if the lover is alone, he is not alone, for his is companioned by the hidden Beloved.","The wine of lovers bubbles up from the breast; love’s companion is in the inmost secrets.","Love is not content with a hundred promises, for the cunning of the heart-enchanters is manifold.","And if you should see a lover sick, is not the fair one at the sick one’s head?","Be a rider of love, and fear not the way, for love’s steed is swift of pace; io With a single bound it brings you to the abode, even though the road be not even.","The soul of the lover knows nothing of fodder-eating, for the souls of lovers are vintners of fine wine.","In Shams al-DTn-i Tabrlzl you will discover a heart which is at once intoxicated and very sober.","Rajab has gone out and Sha‘ban has entered; the soul has quit the body, and the Beloved has entered.","The breath of ignorance and the breath of heedlessness have gone forth; the breath of love and the breath of forgiveness have entered.","The heart is sprouting roses and eglantine and basil, since from the cloud of generosity rain has arrived.","The mouths of all the sorrowful ones are laughing because of this candy which has entered the teeth.","Man is wearing gold brocade like the sun, since that goldscattering moon-faced one has entered.","Clap hands and speak, minstrel oflove, for that ringleader of trouble has entered stamping feet.","If yesterday has gone, may today remain forever, and if ‘Umar has departed, ‘Uthman has entered.","All the past life is returning, since this eternal prosperity has entered.","If you are drunk and asleep in the ship of Noah, why should you worry if the Flood has arrived?","The earth of Tabriz has become lit up like the sky, since Shams al-DIn has entered that maidan {= arena, square}.","We have departed — may the remainder long remain!","Inescapably every man who has been born must depart.","Heaven’s bowl has never seen any dish that did not in the end fall from the roof.","Do not run about so, for in this earth the pupil has become even as the master.","Lovely one, put not on airs, for in this grave many a Shinn has become naughted, the same as Farhad.","After all, what constancy is there in an edifice whose columns are but fragments of wind?","If we were evil, we carried away evil; if we were good, then may you remember!","Though you may be the unique one of your time, today you will be departing as one by one.","If you do not wish to remain alone, make children of obedience to God and good actions.","That thread of unseen light is immortal, because it is the pith of the spirit of the Pegs; That essence of love, which is the quintessence — that remains to all eternity.","If these shifting sands are unstable, another kind of foundation is laid down.","I am like Noah’s ark in this dry land, fc&gt;r that flood is the sealing of the promised time.","Noah made his house an ark, because he saw from the unseen the wave overtowering.","[ HI We have fallen asleep amongst the silent ones, because we have passed all bounds in clamour and lamentation.","That Joseph handsome of cheek has come, that Jesus of the age has come; That banner of a hundred thousand victories has come fluttering over the cavalcade of spring.","You whose business it is to bring the dead to life, arise, for the day of work has come.","The lion which seizes lions a-hunting has come into the meadowland raging drunk.","Yesterday and the day before have departed; seize the cash, for that coin of fair assay has come.","This city today is like paradise; it is saying, The Prince has come.","Beat the drum, for it is the day of festival; be joyous, for the Friend has come.","A moon has lifted its head out of the unseen, in comparison with which this moon has become as dust; Because of the beauty of those souls’ repose, the whole world has become resdess.","Take heed, spread open the skirt oflove, for sprinkling has come from the ninth heaven.","O exile bird with cut pinions, in the place of two wings four have come.","Ho, heart bound in breast, open, for that lost one has come into your bosom.","Foot, come and stamp foot, for that illustrious cupbearer has come.","Speak not of the old man, for he has become young, and speak not of yesteryear, for the Friend has come.","You said, What excuse shall I utter to the king?","The king himself has come making excuses.","You said, Whither shall I escape out of his hand?","His hand has come bringing all succour.","You saw a fire, and light has come; you saw blood, and red wine has come.","That one who was fleeing from his own fortune, having fled, has come back shamefaced.","Be silent, and count not his graces; an innumerable grace it is that has come.","We have become drunk and our heart has departed, it has fled from us — whither has it gone?","When it saw that the chain of reason was broken, immediately my heart took to flight.","It will not have gone to any other place, it has departed to the seclusion of God.","Seek it not in the house, for it is of the air; it is a bird of the air, and has gone into the air.","It is the white falcon of the Emperor; it has taken flight, and departed to the Emperor.","We are foes to ourselves, and friends to him who slays us; we are drowned in the sea, and the waves of the sea are slaying us.","For this reason, laughing and gay, we are yielding up sweet life, because that king is slaying us with honey and sugar and sweetmeat.","We make ourselves out fat for the sacrifice of the feast, because that butcher of lovers slays the very fine and handsome.","That Iblis without light begs for a respite from Him; He gave him respite, because He is slaying him after tomorrow.","Like Ishmael, cheerfully lay your neck before the knife; do not steal your throat away from Him, if He is slaying, until He slays.","Azrael has no power or way to overcome lovers; love itself and passion slays the lovers of love.","The slain ones shout, Would that my people knew; secredy the Beloved bestows a hundred lives, and openly slays.","Put forth a head out of the earth of the body, and then see that He is either drawing you to heaven, or slaying you.","The spirit of breath He takes away, the comfort spiritual He bestows; He releases the falcon of the soul, and slays the owl of sorrow.","That idea the Christian carries abroad, the Moslem has not that idea, that He is slaying this Messiah upon the cross.","Every true lover is like Mansur, they slay themselves; show any beside the lover who deliberately slays himself!","Death daily makes a hundred requisitions on mankind; the lover of God without requisition slays himself.","I make this enough, else I will myself utter the secret of the lovers’ {death}, though the unbeliever slays himself of anger and fury.","Shams-i TabrizI has climbed over the horizon like the sun; unceremoniously he is extinguishing the candles of the stars.","Behold, those birds which lay golden eggs every morning saddle the swift colt of the skies.","When they gallop, the seventh heaven is their arena; when they sleep, they {make their pillow} the sun and the moon.","They are fishes, in the soul of each one of which is a Jonah; they are rosebushes which beautify and order well the skies.","Hell-tasters, heaven-givers, on the day of resurrection they are the rulers, they know neither any blessing nor utter any imprecation.","They set the mountains dancing of subtlety in the air, and convert the seas in sweetness to be like sweet sugar.","They make bodies souls, and souls everlasting; they make stones into ruby mines, and unbelief into faith.","They are more manifest than all, and more hidden than all; if you wish to behold them, they make themselves visible before your eyes.","If you wish to behold clearly, make surmeh {collyrium} of the dust of their feet; for they cause him who was blind from his mother’s womb to see the way.","If you are a thorn, be sharp of point as a thorn in the quest, that they may convert your whole thorn into the likeness of roses and eglantine.","If there were scope for speech, I would utter things that may be spoken, so that the spirits and the angels would applaud out of heaven.","Last night our elephant remembered India again, in frenzy he was rending the veil of night till dawn.","Last night the flagons of the sakis were all overbrimming — O may our life be like last night till the day of resurrection!","The wines were bubbling and the reasons were senseless on account of him; may part and whole, thorn and rose be happy because of his lovely face!","The cup-on-cup clamour of the drunkards mounted to heaven; in our hands was the wine, and in our heads the wind.","Thousands of uproars fell upon the skies because of these, there hundreds of thousands of Kai-Qubads were fallen prostrate.","The day of triumph and good fortune was contained in our night; of the brethren of purity night suddenly gave birth to such a day.","The sea broke into waves; heaven received a token of this night, and in pride set that token on its head and face.","Whatever ways humanity had closed in darkness, the light of divinity in compassion was opening up.","How should the sensible forms on account of that passion remain in place?","How should he remain in place who attains this desire?","Begin life anew, Moslems!","For the Beloved has converted non-entity into being, and dispensed justice to the lovers.","Our Beloved henceforward holds the fallen to be pardonable, because wherever He is the saki no one remains on the right course.","The surging of the sea of grace, Moslems, has wrecked the pomp of personal effort and the programme of belief.","That grace is King Salah al-Din, for he is a Joseph whom the Lord of Egypt himself must purchase at a great price.","I have come to lay my face in the dust of the Beloved’s feet, I have come to beg pardon for a moment for my actions.","I have come to take up anew the service of His rose bower, I have come to bring fire and set my thorns alight.","I have come to get purification from the dust of all that has passed, to reckon my good deeds as evil as performed in the cause of my Beloved; I have come with eyes weeping, that my eyes may behold paradise — fountains consisting of the love of that blandisher of mine.","Rise, disencumbered passion, take up love anew; I have died and become void of my old faith and unbelief; For without your straining-cloth it is impossible to become unsullied in existence, without You it is impossible ever to escape from one’s sorrows and griefs.","Outwardly I have fallen silent; but You know that inwardly I have bloodstained speech in my blood -consuming heart.","In this state of silence examine well my face, that You may see on my cheeks a myriad traces of yourself.","I have shortened this ode; the rest of it is in my heart; I will utter it, if You intoxicate me with your vintner eye.","O silent from speaking, O you sundered from your mate, how did you become thus distraught from your clever reason?","Silent one, how are you faring with these fiery thoughts?","thoughts are arriving with their huge -panoplied army.","When people are alone, they are silent; one speaks with men, no one speaks the secret of his heart to door and wall.","Perchance you find no men to talk with, that you have fallen silent?","Perchance you see no man to be intimate with your words?","Are you haply of the pure world?","Do not you mix with material things, with dogs of natural being who are defiled with their own carrion?","The dead would rend his shroud and rise from the tomb, if that dead man had tidings of my Idol.","What will dead and living do when he discovers something of Him?","For if the mountain beheld Him, it would leap and advance.","I will not flee from blame, for the blame comes from you; from your bitterness all the taste of sugar comes to the soul.","Devour whatever has come to you, leave it not to store up, for you are on the banks of a running stream — when you have drunk, more will come","Behold His fair handiwork, listen to His inspiration to the hearts; become entirely light of vision — all rapture comes from vision.","Do not despair, saying, My life is gone, and the Friend has not come; He comes betimes and out of season, He comes not only at dawn.","Be watchful and wakeful in season and out of season, for suddenly our King enters the eyes like ‘UzaizI antimony.","When He enters this eye, this eye becomes like the sea; when he gazes on the sea, out of all its waters pearls come; Not such a dead pearl that knows not its own essence, pearls will come all speaking, all seeking, altogether alive.","What do you know, what do you know what kind of mind and soul you are?","It is God who knows and sees the virtue that belongs to men.","Become accustomed to speak without lips, like a balance, for lips and teeth do not remain when one passes from the world.","Say, do not despair because the Beloved drives you away; if he drives you away today, will He not call you back tomorrow?","If He shuts the door on you, do not go away; be patient there, for after patience He will seat you in the place of honour.","And if He bars against you all ways and passages, He will show you a secret way, which no man knows.","Is it not the case that when the butcher cuts off the head of a sheep with his knife, he does not abandon what he has slain, but first slays, and then draws?","When no more breath remains to the sheep, he fills it with his own breath; you will see whither God’s breath will bring you!","I spoke this as a parable; else, His generosity slays no man, rather it rescues him from slaying.","He gives all the kingdom of Solomon to a single ant; He bestows both worlds, and does not startle a single heart.","My heart has travelled round the world and found none like him; whom does He resemble?","Whom does He resemble?","Ah, silence!","For without speech He gives to all of this wine to taste, He gives to taste, He gives to taste, He gives to taste.","Ho, lovers, labour so that, when body and soul remain no more, your hearts may fly to heaven, not remain heavy like the body.","Wash your hearts and souls in the water of wisdom clean of dust, ho, that the two eyes of regret may not remain turned towards the earth.","Is it not the case with everything in the world, that love is its vital soul?","Apart from love, everything you see remains not eternally.","Your nonexistence (before birth) is as the east, your death is as the west, oriented to another heaven that resembles not this visible heaven.","The way to heaven is within; shake the wings of love — when love’s wings have become strong, there is no need to trouble about a ladder.","Consider not the world that exists without, for the true world is within the eye; when you have shut your eyes on the world, the world will not remain.","Your heart is like a roof, and your senses are waterspouts; drink water from the roof, for the waterspout remains not for ever.","Recite entirely this ode from the tablet of the heart; regard not the tongue, for lips and tongue do not remain.","Man’s body is a bow, breath and speech are as its arrows; once the arrows and quiver have gone, no more work remains for the bow.","All slept, and yet sleep did not transport me, heart-forlorn as i am; all night my eyes counted the stars in the sky.","Sleep had so departed from my eyes as if never to return; my sleep had quaffed the poison of separation from you, and expired.","How would it be if you concocted a remedy out of encounter for one wounded, who has committed his heart and eyes to your hands?","No, it is not right to close the door of beneficence once and for all; if you will not give pure wine, less than one mouthful of dregs will you not give?","God has placed all manners of delight in a single chamber; no man without you ever found the right way into that chamber.","If I have become dust in the path of love, regard me not as insignificant; how should he who beats on the door of union with you be insignificant?","Fill my sleeve with unseen pearls — a sleeve which has wiped many a tear from these eyes.","Whenever the policeman of love has constrained anyone on a dark night, your moon has compassionately pressed him in its silvery bosom.","If the wandering heart returns of your grace, it is the story of the night, the disk of the moon, the camel, and the Kurd.","Were not these inanimates originally of water?","The world is a cold place; it came and congealed one by one.","Our blood in our body is the water of life, and sweet; when it comes forth from its place, see how it is all the same!","Do not congeal the water of speech, and bring it not from that fountain, so that it is silk on that side and striped cloth on this.","have you heard that sugar has become cheap in the town?","have you heard that winter has vanished and summer is here?","Have you heard that basil and carnation in the garden are laughing surreptitiously because affairs have become easy?","Have you heard that the nightingale has returned from his travels, joined in the concert and become the master of all the birds?","Have you heard that now in the garden the branches of the trees have heard glad news of the rose, and shake their hands?","Have you heard that the soul has become drunk from the cup of spring, and gone off gay and dancing into the Sultan’s sanctuary?","Have you heard that the anemone’s cheeks are suffused with blood?","Have you heard that the rose has become head chamberlain of the divan?","Have you heard about the thievishness of mad December, how the just officer of spring has come, and he has disappeared?","These idols have obtained laissez-passer from the divan, so that the earth has become green and arrayed in full splendour.","If the beauties of the garden last year wrought wonders, each one this year has emerged in beauty a hundredfold as great.","io Rose-cheelced ones have come forth whirling out of nonexistence, such that the stars in heaven are but scatter before their feet.","The deposed narcissus has become the inspector of the kingdom; the infant bud like Jesus has become understanding and chanting.","The feast of these creatures of joy has once more taken on ornament; once more the breeze of the zephyr bestows wine on the garden.","There were images hidden behind the veil of the heart; the orchards have become mirrors to the secret of their hearts.","Whatever you behold, seek from the heart, do not seek from the mirror; the mirror may receive an image, but it cannot become alive.","All the dead ones of the garden have come to life at the summons of God; their unbelief by God’s mercy has all been turned to faith.","They are continuing in their shrouds, and are all stirring, for that which is alive cannot become pledged for ever to prison; He said, Make this enough, for I will expound this better than this.","I shut my mouth, for He had come and become surety.","The King’s lips will likewise describe all completely, if the summary has departed from you into the bosom of concealment.","This fledgling pigeon essayed the air and flew off when he heard a whisde and a call from the unseen.","When that Desire of all the world sent a messenger saying, Come to Me, how should not the disciple’s soul take flight?","How should it not fly upwards on discovering such pinions, how should it not rend the body’s robe on the arrival of such a missive?","What a moon it is that draws all these souls!","What a way is that secret way by which it drew!","Divine compassion sent a letter saying, Come back hither, for in this narrow cage your soul has fluttered much.","But in the house without doors you are like a bird without wings; so the fowl of the air does when it has fallen low.","Restlessness opens to it the door of compassion at last; beat your wings against door and roof — this is the key.","Until you call on Me, you do not know the way of returning; for by Our calling the way becomes manifest to the reason.","Whatever mounts up, if it be old it becomes new; whatever new descends here, through time it becomes threadbare.","Ho, strut proudly into the unseen, do not look back, in god’s protection, for there all is profit and increase.","Ha, silent one, depart to the Saki of Being, who gave you his pure wine in this sullied cup.","IOO Lord, is this sweet scent coming from the meadow of the soul, or is it a breeze wafting from beyond the world?","Lord, from what homeland does this water of life bubble up?","lord, from what place comes this light of the attributes?","Amazing!","Does this clamour arise from the troop of the angels?","Amazing!","Does this laughter come from the houris of paradise?","What concert is it, that the soul spins round dancing?","What whisde is it, that the heart is coming flapping wings?","What a marriage feast it is!","What a wedding!","Heaven is like a curtain; the moon with this plate of gold for a sign is coming.","What a hunt!","For the arrow of fate is flying; if it is not so, why comes the sound of the bow?","Good news, good news, lovers all!","Clap your hands, for he who once escaped from your hands is coming clapping.","From the fortress of the skies the cry of safe quarter is arising, and from the sea such a wave of fear is coming.","The eye of prosperity is intoxicated with your approaching; this is a proof that is obvious to the eye.","Escape from this world of dearth, where lances strike for the sake of two or three loaves.","What is fairer than life?","Yet if life should go, have no fear; why do you grieve about its departing, seeing that better than it is coming?","Every man is amazed at something; my amazement is, how it is that when He enters the midst, He is not contained in the midst.","Let me have done.","Though it is a cipher, I will not explain it; what are you trying to explain?","The soul of explanation is coming.","IOI Amazing keeper of the hot baths!","When he comes forth from seclusion, every painted figure of the baths falls into prostration!","The figures, frozen, unconscious, dead — from the reflection of his eyes their eyes open large as narcissi.","Through his ears their ears become familiar with fables, through his eyes their eyes become receptive of vistas.","You behold every single bath-figure drunk and dancing, like a boon companion who from time to time plunges in red wine.","The courtyard of the baths is full of their clamour and shouting; the riotous clamour marks the first day of resurrection.","The figures call one another unto themselves; one figure from that corner there comes laughing to another figure","But no form discovers the bath-keeper himself, for all that form is running hither and thither in search of him.","All are distracted, he behind and before them, unrecognized, the king of the souls comes at the head of the army.","The rosebed of every mind is filled with roses from his cheeks; the skirt of every beggar is filled with gold from his hand.","io Hold your basket before him, that he may fill it of himself, so that the basket of your poverty may become the despair of sanjar.","Judge and plaintiff alike flee from less and more, when that moon for one moment enters drunk into the assembly.","The wine becomes the tavern, the dead become riotous drunk, the wood becomes the Moaning Pillar when he enters the pulpit.","He denies them his presence, and their forms freeze, their eyes vanish, their ears become deaf.","When he appears again their eyes open, the garden becomes full of birds, the orchard is verdant.","Go to the rosebed and the garden, behold the friends and the chatter; in the wake of this expression the soul comes to that pass.","How can one tell what was manifested, friend?","How can the pen indite that, for all that it enters the inkholder?","Little by little the drunkards congregate, little by little the wine -worshippers arrive.","The heart-cherishers coquettishly come along the way, the rosy-cheelced ones are arriving from the garden.","Little by little from the world of being and not-being the not-beings have departed and the beings are arriving.","All with skirts full of gold as a mine are arriving for the sake of the destitute.","The lean and sick from the pasturage of love are arriving fat and hale.","The souls of the pure ones like the rays of the sun are arriving from such a height to the lowly ones.","Blessed is that garden, where, for the sake of the Mary’s, new fruits are arriving even in winter.","Their origin is grace, and their return is grace; even from the garden to the garden they are coming.","Laughter tells of your lovingkindness, tears complain of your wrath; These two mutually contrary messages relate in this world about a single Beloved.","Lovingkindness beguiles a heedless man in such a way that he is not anxious about wrath, and commits sin; The other man wrath endows with hopelessness, so that he keeps complete despair.","Love, like a pitying intercessor, comes to the protection of both these lost souls.","We give thanks for this love, O God, which performs infinite lovingkindnesses; Whatever shortcomings in our gratitude we may be guilty of, love suffices to make amends for it.","Is this love Kauthar, or the Water of Life?","It makes life without bound and term; Between the sinner and God, like the Messenger, it runs much to and fro and busies itself greatly.","Make an end of verse on verse; do not recite this; love itself will interpret the verse.","The lovers visible and the Beloved invisible — who ever saw such a love in all the world?","Not one lip having attained the form of the Beloved, hundreds of thousands of souls have expired.","Two bowshots’ distance shot an arrow from the heights, so that it fore through the shields of the skies.","Not having drawn the skirt of the Beloved of the Unseen, the hearts of thousands have suffered tribulation and beating; Not having bitten the lip of Him whose lip is sweet, how many have bitten the back of the hand in banishment!","Not having grazed on the sugar-cane of His lip, the heart has grazed on His thousands of blandishments.","Not one rose having blossomed from His rosegarden, hundreds of thousands of thorns have pricked in the breast.","Though the soul has experienced nothing but cruelty from Him, it has fled away from mortal fidelities in hope of him; It has preferred that pain over generosities, and has chosen that cruelty above all fidelities.","His thorn has triumphed over all roses, His lock is more delightful than a hundred keys.","His tyranny has carried off the ball from the turn of good fortune; candies have blossomed from the poison of His wrath.","His rejection is better than the reception of others; ruby and pearl are desirous of His stone.","These worldly happinesses are nothing; seek that happiness which Bu SaTd possesses.","These augmentations of this world are less; seek that augmentation which Ba Yazld possesses.","That augmentation is your six-fingered hand; its value is less, though apparendy it is augmenting.","Seek that radiance which Sana’I expounded, that Unique one whose uniqueness ‘Attar revealed.","Fat and sweet food appear pure and good; one night they passed with you, and became filth.","Eat the fat and sweet of the food of love, that your wings may sprout and you may know how to fly.","After all, Abraham as a child in the cave sucked from the fingertips of a lion.","Dismiss that; that foetus in the womb sucked the water of life from blood.","The tall stature which heaven made upright in the end became bowed like the crooked heaven; The tall stature which Love raised up, its stature transcended the glorious Throne.","Nay, be silent; He who knows all secrets is present; He said, We are nearer than the jugular vein.","Our death is an eternal wedding-feast; what is the secret of this?","He is God, One.","The sun became dispersed through the windows; the windows became shut, and the numbers departed.","Those numbers which existed in the grapes are naughted in the juice which flows from the grapes.","Whosoever is living by the light of God, the death of this spirit is replenishment to him.","Speak not evil, speak not good regarding those who have passed away from good and evil.","Fix your eye on God, and speak not of what you have not seen, that He may implant another eye in your eye.","That eye is the eye of the eye, nothing unseen or secret escapes from it.","When its gaze is by the Light of God, to such a light what can be hidden?","Though all lights are the Light of God, call not all of those the eternal Light.","io Eternal light is that which is the Light of God, transient light is the attribute of flesh and body.","The light in this mortal eye is a fire, save for that eye which god anoints with surmeh {collyrium}.","His fire became light for the sake of Abraham; the eye of reason became in quality like the eye of an ass.","O God, the bird of the eye which has seen Your bounty flies in Your air.","The Pole, he who is the sky of the skies, is on the lookout in search of You; Either grant him vision to see You, or do not dismiss him on account of this fault.","Make tearful the eye of your soul every moment, guard it against the snare of human stature and cheek.","Eye asleep and yourself wakeful — such a sleep is perfection and rectitude; But the eye asleep that finds no interpretation (of dreams) — expel it from sleep, despite envy.","Else it will labour and be boiling in the fire of love of the one, even to the grave.","io everywhere the scent of God is coming — see how the people are coming uncontrollably; From him for whom all souls are athirst, to the thirsty the cry of the water carrier is coming.","They are milk drinkers of divine generosity, and are on the watch to see from whence the mother is coming.","They are in separation, and all are waiting to see whence union and encounter are coming.","From Moslems, Jews, and Christians alike every dawn the sound of prayer is coming; Blessed is that intelligence into whose heart’s ear from heaven the sound of Come hither is coming.","Keep your ear clean of scum, for a voice is coming from heaven; The defiled ear hears not that sound — only the deserving gets his deserts.","Defile not your eye with human cheek and mole, for that emperor of eternal life is coming; And if it has become defiled, wash it with tears, for the cure comes from those tears.","A caravan of sugar has arrived from Egypt; the sound of footfall and bells is coming.","Fla, be silent, for to complete the ode our speaking King is coming.","Again the sun of felicity has mounted to heaven, again the desire of the souls has arrived from the way of the soul.","Again by the good pleasure of Ridwan the gates of paradise have been opened, every spirit is plunged up to its neck in the pool of Kauthar.","Again that King, who is the altar to whom kings turn, has entered, again that Moon surpassing the moon has entered.","These distraught by mad passion have all mounted their steeds, for that King, the unique cavalier, has entered the heart of the army.","The particles of dark earth are all bewildered and amazed, having heard from placelessness the cry, Arise, the resurrection has come!","The inexpressible proclamation has come, not from within and not from without, not left, not right, not behind, not from before.","You say, What direction is that?","That direction where there is questing.","You say, Whither shall I turn my face?","thither this head has come; Thither whence this ripeness came upon the fruits, thither whence the attributes of gems came upon the stones; Thither where the dry fish came to life before Khidar, thither whence Moses’ hand became as a radiant moon.","This burning in our hearts has become bright as a candle, this decree has come upon our heads like a crown of pride","The soul has not leave to utter this exposition, else every infidel would have escaped from unbelief.","The unbeliever in hardship turns his lace thither; when he experiences pain on this side, he believes in that side.","Continue in pain, that pain may show you the road thither; that place who sees?","The man who is constrained by pain.","That most mighty Emperor has closed the door fast; today he has put on human apparel and entered by the door.","The sea can always dispense with the fish, for in comparison with the sea the fish is contemptible.","You will not find fish, my soul, like the sea of the ocean; in the sea of God’s ocean there are many fish.","The sea is like a nurse, the fish like a sucking child; the wretched infant is always weeping for milk.","Yet for all this indifference, if the sea should compassionately incline towards a fish, great will be the grace; And that fish which knows that the sea is seeking him — his foot in pride rises above the ether.","That fish which — the sea does no task without the fish’s opinion is its counsellor — You might say that so highly favoured a fish is an emperor, and that infinite sea is his

transcending eye and imagination and spirit.","Do you desire to stitch yourself to it?","Arise, and rend the veil of the carnal soul.","That subtle spirit became a form with eyebrows and eyes and brown skin.","God the Inscrutable disclosed Himself to the form of the chosen Prophet.","That form of his passed away in the Form, and that eye of his, like the day of resurrection.","Every time he looked upon men, a hundred doors were opened by God.","When the form of the Chosen One passed away, God is most Great seized the world.","I have a bad habit; I am weary; pray excuse me.","How shall my habit become seemly without your fair face, my beauty?","Without you I am like winter, people are formented because of me; with you I am as a rose bower, my habit is the habit of spring.","Without you I lack reason, I am weary, everything I say is crooked, I am ashamed of reason and reason is shamefast at the light of your face.","What is the remedy for bad water?","To return to the river.","What is the remedy for bad habits?","To see the beloved’s lace again.","I see the water of the soul imprisoned in this whirlpool of the body; I dig out the earth to make a way to the sea.","You have a potion which you give the despairing, secretly, lest the hopeful, grieving for it, should utter lamentation.","O heart, so much as you are able do not withhold your eye from the Beloved, whether He withdraws from you or draws you into His bosom.","Each moment I catch from my bosom the scent of the Beloved; how should I not take my self every night into my bosom?","Last night I was in Love’s garden; that desire ran into my head; his sun peeped out of my eye, so that the river began to flow.","Every laughing rose that springs from the bank of that river oflove had escaped from the thorn of being and eluded dhu ’i-Eaqar; Every tree and grass was a-dancing in the meadow, but in the eye of the vulgar was bound and at rest.","Suddenly from one side our Cypress appeared, so that the garden was beside itself and the plane-tree clapped its hands.","Face like fire, wine like fire, love afire — all three delightful; soul because of the intermingled fires lamenting, Whither shall i flee?","In the world of Divine Unity there is no room for number, but number exists of necessity in the world of five and four.","You may count a myriad sweet apples in your hand; if you want to make one, squeeze them all together.","A myriad grapes went forth from the veil of skin; when skin no more remained, there remained the wine of the Prince.","Without counting the letters, behold what is this speech of the heart; unicolority — is it not a form derived from the root of the affair?","Shams-i TabrizI is seated like a king, and before him my verses are ranged like willing slaves.","Reason is the chain of travellers and lovers, my son; break the chain, and the way is plain and clear ahead, my son.","Reason is a chain, heart a cheat, body a delusion, soul a veil; the way is hidden from all these heavinesses, my son.","When you have risen out of reason, soul, and heart, and you have gone forth, still this certainty and this direct vision is in doubt, my son.","The man who has not departed out of self is not a man, my son; the love which is not of the soul is but a legend, my son.","Set up your breast as a target before the arrow of His decree; be sharp, for the arrow of His decree is already in the bow, my son.","The breast that has been wounded by the striking of the arrow of His tug, on its brow and face are a hundred marks, my son.","If you mount like Idris to the seventh heaven, the love of the beloved is an excellent ladder indeed, my son.","On every side where a caravan takes its proud way behold love, which is the qiblci of the caravan, my son.","His love has cast a shadow on the earth like a snare; His huntsmanlike love is in heaven, my son.","Enquire not of me concerning love, enquire not of any man, enquire of Love itself; Love in speaking is like a pearl-raining cloud, my son.","Love requires not the interpreter service of me and a hundred like me; concerning realities Love is its own interpreter, my son.","Love is not the business of those asleep or soft and delicate, love is the business of the brave and of heroes, my son.","Whoso has become the servant of lovers and true ones, he is a king, an emperor, a master of fortune, my son.","Let not this world full of magic spells lure you away from love, lor this faithless world is leaping away from you, my son.","If the verses of this ode have become long in its joins, the tune has changed but the meaning is the same, my son.","Take heed, close your mouth and be silent henceforth like an oyster shell, for this tongue of yours is in reality the enemy of the soul, my son.","tonight is a night of union for the stars and of scattering, scattering, since a bride is coming from the skies, consisting of a full moon.","Venus cannot contain herself for charming melodies, like the nightingale which becomes intoxicated with the rose in springtime.","See how the Polestar is ogling Leo; behold what dust Pisces is stirring up from the deep!","Jupiter has galloped his steed against ancient Saturn, saying, Take back your youth and go, bring good tidings!","Mars’ hand, which was full of blood from the handle of his sword, has become life-giving as the sun, the exalted in works.","Since Aquarius has come full of that water of life, the dry cluster of Virgo is raining pearls from him.","The Pleiades (nut) full of goodness fears not Libra and being broken; how should Aries flee away in fright from its mother?","When from the moon the arrow of a glance struck the heart of Sagittarius, he took to night-faring in passion for her, like scorpio.","On such a festival, go, sacrifice Taurus, else you are crooked of gait in the mud like Cancer.","This sky is the astrolabe, and the reality is Love; whatever we say of this, attend to the meaning.","Shams-i Tabriz, on that dawn when you shine, the dark night is transformed to bright day by your moonlike face.","That beauty handed me a broom saying, Stir up the dust from the sea!","He then burned the broom in the fire saying, Bring up the broom out of the fire!","In bewilderment I made prostration before him; he said, Without a prostrator, offer a graceful prostration!","Ah, how prostrate without a prostrator?","He said, Unconditionally, without personal impulse.","I lowered my neck and said, Cut off the head of a prostrator with Dhu TFaqar.","The more he struck with the sword, the more my head grew, till heads a myriad sprouted from my neck; I was a lamp, and every head of mine was as a wick; sparks flew on every side.","Candles sprang up out of my heads, east to west was filled with the train.","What are east and west in the placeless?","A dark bath-stove, and a bath at work.","io You whose temperament is cold, where is the anxiety of your heart?","How long this dwelling at rest in these baths?","Go forth from the baths and enter not the stove; strip yourself, and look upon those paintings and figures, Until you behold the ravishing figures, until you behold the hues of the tulip -bed.","When you have beheld, look towards the window, for that beauty became a beauty through the reflection of the window.","The six directions are the bath, and the window is the placeless; above the window is the beauty of the Prince.","Earth and water acquired colour from his reflection, soul rained on Turk and Zanzibari.","The day is gone, and my story has not grown short — O night and day put to shame by his tale","King Shams al-Din-i Tabriz!","keeps me intoxicated, cropsickness upon crop-sickness.","I went there intoxicated and said, O beauty, when you have maddened me, give ear!","He replied, See, in my ear is a ring; become fastened to that ring like a pendant.","I quickly reached out to touch his ring; he struck me saying, Hold back your hand from me!","You will find the way into this ring only when you become a royal pearl in purity.","My golden ring, and then a bead!","How should Jesus go up to heaven on an ass?","Joyous spring has arrived and the Beloved’s message has come; we are drunk with love and intoxicated and cannot be still.","O my darling one, go forth to the garden, do not leave the beauties of the meadow in expectation.","Strangers from the Unseen have arrived in the meadow; go forth, for it is a rule that the newcomer is visited.","Following your footsteps the rose has come into the rosebower, to greet and meet you the thorn has become soft of cheek.","Cypress, give ear, for the lily in exposition of you has become all tongue by the bank of the river.","The bud was tightly knotted; your grace looses knots; the rose blossoms thanks to you, and scatters its petals over you.","You might say that it is the resurrection, that there have raised their heads from the earth those who rotted in December and January, the dead of yesteryear.","The seed which had died has now found life, the secret which earth held has now become revealed.","The bough which held fruit is glorying for joy, the root which had none is shamefast and ashamed.","After all, the trees of the spirit will become even so, the tree of excellent boughs and fortunate will be manifest.","The king of spring has drawn up his army and made his provisions; the jasmine has seized the shield, the green grass Dhu tFaqar.","They say, We will cut off the head of So-and-so like chives; behold that visibly enacted in the handiwork of the Creator."," Yes; when the succour of divine assistance arrives, Nimrod is brought to destruction by a gnat.","Do not slacken the bowstring, for I am your four-feathered arrow; do not turn your face away, for I am a man with one heart, not two-headed.","From you is the striking of the sharp sword, from the heart and soul a hundred consents; I am a man of one word like fate, I am not if or perhaps!","If you draw Dhu ’i-Faqar I am constant and firm of foot, I do not flee like the wind, I do not die like a spark.","I will surrender my soul to the sword, I will not say alas; God has made me like a shield for the blows of His sword.","Sun, smite with your glow the neck of the night as with a sword; whence comes the darkness of the nights?","From the forge of muddy earth.","The body is a mine of endurance, the heart is a mine of gratitude, the bosom is a mine of laughter, the liver is a mine of compassion.","Make your throne, O king, on my head as a cap; tightly draw me into your breast as a garment.","Someone said, Whence has Love form and hands?","Love is the sprouting-bed of every hand and foot in the forms.","Did not your father and mother play at love for one moment?","When they were united, one like you made his appearance.","io Do not regard Love, which without hands made your hand a hand, as being without hand or head; look in another fashion.","You who have eyes to see, the colour of all faces, the water of all rivers — know these are Shams-i Haqq, the Pride of tabriz.","He said, My sugar-sweet lip is worth a treasure of pearls.","Ah, I have no pearls.","He said, You have not?","Then buy!","Make a snare for me out of pearls, and if that does not succeed, then borrow.","You have mistaken the house, you lover without silver and gold!","You have come to a gambling-match; bring a purse full of gold.","Else, leave us and be gone, do not vex and trouble us more.","We are highwaymen, we are renders of garments; if you are one of us, come in, drink and drink deep!","We tear to shreds all snares, we devour all properties; we are sweeter than all others — despite all the blind and deaf.","Those who buy garments are different from those who rend them; those who rend garments pluck out the mustachios of every garment-buyer.","The Moses of the soul plucked out the mustachios of the Pharaoh of the body, so that the body becomes all soul, every hair-tip alive.","Recognize the travellers on the path of his love by their pallid cheeks; know that the pearls oflove are tears, love’s silk the heart’s blood.","What is the worth of the gold-pale cheek?","Say: the ruby of the Beloved.","What is the worth of the pearl-like tear?","Say: that glance.","io We are slaves to that saki, till eternity we continue; our world is secure and content, the worldlings are passing by.","Whoever has been born has died and committed his soul to the guardian angel; the lover was born of no man, love has no father.","If you are not of this face, then sit behind like the nape; if you are not the nape, then advance like a shield.","Advance like a shield unconscious, and behold how the conscious ones are struck unconscious by the glance of the Friend’s blow.","God has written around the cheek of the Beloved the inscription Therefore take heed of him, you who have eyes.","Since Love devours men, it is necessary for a man to make himself a morsel before man-devouring Love.","You are a sour morsel, and are very long digesting; the saint is a sweet morsel easy to digest.","Do you break the morsel you are, because that mouth is narrow; even three elephants would not devour you, save at three gulps.","In face of your greed the elephant itself is a morsel; you are like the ababll birds which made the elephant their prey.","You were born of non-entity, come after a long famine; to you, fattened bird as food and serpent and snake are the same","You have come to a hot cauldron; now you burn your mouth, now you blacken your clothes and lips and turban.","With nothing are you sated, like the belly of hell, save perchance the Almighty Creator sets His loot on you, Even as He sets His foot on the head of hell, and hell proclaims, Enough, I am full, lift up Your loot!","God satiates the eye of the saints and the elect, lor they are delivered from self and from greed lor this carrion.","No greed remains in them for knowledge and science, no desire for paradise; the lion-rider does not seek for ass or camel.","Silence!","Were I to count His gifts and donations, resurrection day itself would become giddy and confounded at the tally.","Come, Pride of Tabriz, true Shams al-DTn; the sun in the spinning skies is your humble slave.","Look not for happiness when the Beauty’s inclination is set on sorrow, for you are prey in the clutches of a lion, my dear friend.","Though the Beloved sprinkles plaster on your head, welcome that as if it was Tartary musk.","Since within you lurks a hidden enemy, there is no repelling that monster save by harshness.","The man who beats a stick on a rug, it is not aimed at the rug, but the whole purpose is to rid the rug of dust.","Layers of dust are within you, consisting of the veil of egoism; that dust is not got rid of at a single blow; With each harshness and each blow, little by litrie that is dispersed from the cheek of the heart, now sleeping, now awake.","If you take flight in sleep, in dreams you will see the cruelty of the Beloved and the execrations of that Benefactor.","Scraping a stick is not in order to destroy the stick, it is for a good purpose in the heart of the carpenter.","For this reason every evil on God’s path is good, for that He will show man pure and refined at the end of the affair, io Consider the hide which the tanner rubs in all manner of filth a thousand times over, So that the inward flaw may go forth from the hide, even though the hide knows naught oflittle or much.","Sun and Pride of Tabriz, you possess great virtues; make haste, for you have a mighty power in the secrets.","If a tree could move on foot or wing, it would not suffer the pain of the saw or the blows of the axe; And if the sun did not travel on wing and foot all the night, how would the world be illumined at morningtide?","If the salt water did not rise from the sea to the sky, whence would the garden be revived by forrent and rain?","When the drop departed from its homeland and returned, it encountered a shell and became a pearl.","Did not Joseph go from his father on a journey, weeping?","Did he not on the journey attain felicity and kingdom and victory?","Did not Mustafa go on a journey towards Yathrib, gain sovereignty, and become king of a hundred lands?","And you — if you have no foot, choose to journey into yourself; like a ruby-mine be receptive to a print from the sunbeams.","Make a journey out of self into self, my master, for by such a journey earth became a mine of gold.","Go out of sourness and bitterness towards sweetness, just as a thousand sorts of fruits have escaped out of bitterness.","Seek sweetness from the Sun, the Pride of Tabriz, for every fruit gains comeliness from the light of the sun.","Look on me, for I shall be your companion in the grave on that night when you pass across from shop and house","You will hear my greeting in the tomb, and you will be aware that not for a moment you have been veiled from my eyes.","I am like reason and mind within your veil, alike in time of pleasure and happiness and in the hour of pain and weariness.","On the strange night, when you hear the voice familiar, you will escape from the bite of snake and leap away from the horror of ant; Love’s intoxication will bring to your grave, as a gift, wine and mistress and candle and meats and sweets and incense.","On the hour when we light the lamp of the intellect, what a tumult of joy shall go up from the dead in the tombs!","The dust of the graveyard will be confounded by those cries, by the din of the drum of resurrection, the pomp and panoply of the uprising — Shrouds rent asunder, two ears stopped up in terror; what shall avail brain and ear before the blast of the trumpet?","On whatever side you gaze, you will behold my form, whether you gaze on yourself or towards that uproar and confusion.","Flee from squinteyedness, and make good both your eyes, for the evil eye on that day will be far from my beauty.","Beware of mistaking me in a human shape, for the spirit is very subtle, and Love is exceedingly jealous.","What room is there for form, if the felt be a hundredfold?","It is the rays of the soul’s mirror that pitch the flag visibly.","Beat the drum, and wind towards the minstrels of the city; it is the day of purification to the grown lads of the road of Love.","Had they sought God, instead of morsel and pence, you would not have seen one blind man seated on the edge of the moat.","What sort of ogling-house have you opened in our city!","mouth shut, shoot out glances, like light.","My bowl has broken, and no wine has remained to me, and i am crop-siclc; let Shams-e Din set in order my disordered estate — Prince of the world of vision, lamp of the world of revelation, to whom the spirits make heartfelt obeisance from afar, That his hand may bring out of the sea of bewilderment a thousand souls and spirits drowned and utterly whelmed.","If heaven and earth were filled with the darkness of unbelief, when he shines, his rays flood all that with light.","That pure radiance which the angels discover from him — if it should reach the satans, they would all become houris.","And even if that light belonged not for a single day to the devil, he would veil the devil with the veils of his bountifulness.","On the day of festival, when he begins to dispense, on every side is a marriage feast, in every quarter a wedding party.","From the direction of Tabriz that sun shines — the atoms come to life as at the blast of the trumpet.","Zephyr, for God’s sake and by the right of bread and salt — for every dawn I and you have been rejoiced by him — When you come to the end of the frontiers of the unseen world, pass over them, and be not lazy as one sick and suffering.","On that wing which you have gotten from him fly; for a thousand years’ journey will not be far from your wing.","Fly; and when your wing becomes weary, prostrate yourself for the sake of my state, weary of soul and sundered of heart; Tell him with tears that since the time of our separation, my day has become black and my hairs camphor-white.","You are he who dips in the sea of compassion all the sinners of the world, and makes them forgiven.","If the seeing eye cannot penetrate to your soul, he who has no eye may truly be excused.","So contrive by entreaty as to bring the dust of his feet to the eye, for this sickness is becoming gangrenous.","And when, zephyr, you return prospering from this journey, you will stir up commotion and sparks indeed in existence and nonexistence alike.","When you bring me his eye salve, may a thousand new compassions be upon your soul for centuries beyond reckoning!","Minstrel of the lovers, shake the string, strike fire into believer and infidel!","Silence is not the proper course oflove; unveil the face of welfare.","Until the infant in the cradle weeps, how shall the anxious mother give it milk?","Whatever is other than the phantom of the Beloved is the thorn of Love, even if it be a rosebower.","Minstrel, when you have reached to dilate my heart, have a care; you have set your foot in blood — Set your foot slowly, lest a drop of the heart’s blood splash out on the wall.","Minstrel, observe well the wounds of the heart; so long as they are not conscious of their pain, be at ease.","Minstrel, mention the name of the beloved who has robbed our heart of fortitude and quietude.","What have I said?","Where has a heart remained still?","If my heart were a mountain, it had gone out of control.","Speak his name, and name me less, that I may nickname you Excellent of speech.","When I speak of how he moves, where does my heart go?","brave movement indeed!","Shams-i Tabriz, you are the Jesus of the age; in your age there is such a sick one.","Who has compassion on a friend?","A friend likewise.","Who hears the sigh of the sick?","The sick.","Where are the tears of sympathetic spring, that they may fill the thorn’s skirt with roses?","Mention often the demolisher of joy; give ear to pitiless autumn.","The cave becomes paradise, when he is in it: the second of Wo, when the Wo were in the Cave.","Heaven splits in two at the sigh of a lover; the lamentation of lovers is not to be despised.","Heaven revolves lor the sake of lovers; on account of love the sky spins around, Not for the sake of baker and smith, not for the sake of carpenter and druggist.","The skies rotate about love; rise, that we may also circle around.","Consider who said, But for thee I would not have created; ahmad the Chosen is the mine of love.","For a while let us circle about loverhood; how long shall we circle about this carrion?","Where is the eye to behold the spirits, putting their heads out from door and wall?","Door and wall tell subtleties, fire and earth and water rehearse a tale; Like the balance, the yardstick and the touchstone they are without tongue, yet arbiters of the market.","Lover, circle about like the sky, silent from speaking, and altogether speech.","So drunk am I, so drunk am I today that I have leaped out of the hoop today.","Such a thing as never enters the mind, even so am I, even so am I today.","In spirit I departed to the heaven of Love, even though in form I am in this low world today.","I took reason by the ear and said, Reason, go out, for I have escaped from you today.","Reason, wash your hands of me, for I am joined with the mad lover today.","That Joseph gave into my hand an orange; as a result, I have wounded both my hands today.","That jug full of wine has brought me to such a state that I have broken so many jars today.","I do not know where I am, but it is a blessed station in which i am today.","Good fortune came coquettishly to my door; out of drunkenness I closed the door to him today.","When he returned, I kept running after him, I did not sit down for a moment today.","Since We are nearer has been realized, I will not worship myself any more today.","Do not tie up that tress, Shams al-DIn-i Tabriz, for I am like a fish in this net today.","The love of that cherisher of lovers has come to his own house; Love has in form-conceiving a form melting all forms.","You have come to your own house; welcome, enter!","Your coming is with joy; enter by the door of the heart, run to the vestibule of the soul.","Every mote of my being is in love with your sun; take heed, for motes have long transaction with the sun.","See how before the window the motes gracefully suspended beat; whoever has the sun for a qibla prays after this fashion.","In the concert of the sun these motes are like Sufis; no one knows to what recitation, to what rhythm, to what harmony.","In every heart there is a different note and rhythm, all stamping feet outwardly, and the minstrels hidden like a secret.","Loftier than all is our inward concert, our particles dancing therein with a hundred kinds of glory and pride.","Shams-i Tabriz!, you are the sultan of the sultans of the soul; no Mahmud like you ever came into being, nor like me any ayaz.","Night is broad and long for the sake of lovers and thieves; ho, come, strumpet night, and do the business of both!","I steal carnelians and pearls from the sultan’s treasury, I am not mean that I should steal the draper’s cloth.","Within the veil of the nights there are subtle thieves who by cunning find a way to the roof of the house of mystery.","My ambition in night-faring and knavery is nothing less than the king’s treasury and the carnelian of that king of glory.","The cheek before whose onslaught night remains no more in the world — brave lamp, which lights the sun and fashions the moon!","All the needs of men are granted on the Night of Power, for Power attained that exaltation from a full moon like you.","You are all, and beyond all what else is there, that it should enter the imagination that anyone is your peer?","Ho, pass away from this; open wide your ears, for I am beginning a tale entirely rare and strange.","Since you have not seen Messiah, give ear to the legend; fly like a white falcon towards the falcon-drum.","Since you are a coin of red gold, receive the seal of the king; if you are not red gold, then why all this snipping?","In the time when you became a treasure you did not realize that, wherever a treasure is, the informer sets to work.","Bring your treasure, and play no tricks, for you will not escape by vapouring and prostration and commemoration and abstinence and prayer.","Do you steal, and then sit in the corner of the mosque saying, I am the Junaid of the age, the Ba Yazld of supplication?","Give back the cloth, then get on with your abstinence; do not make feeble excuses and babble your tale.","Hush your pretexts, for in this station men do not purchase a single grain by dissimulation and artful trickery.","Seize the skirt of felicity of Shams-i TabrlzT, that your perfection may be embroidered from the magic of his sleeve.","Sour-faced one, in my presence you spoke evil of me; the mouth of the vulture always smells of carrion.","Your filthy words became apparent in your face; vileness is ever manifest in the face and complexion of the nobody.","I have a Friend and Beloved, so go on grinding away at death and enmity; take heed, the ocean was never defiled by the mouth of any dog.","Though the Holy City has become filled with Frankish pigs, after all how has that brought the Holy Temple a bad name?","This is the face of the mirror; Joseph shines in it; the back, however that it is gilded, is a stranger.","If the bat thinks evil, the sun is not grieved — how is the sun impaired, if the shadow is upside down?","Jesus was a laugher, John the Baptist a frowner; the former laughed out of trust, the latter frowned from fear.","They said, O Lord, which of these two is better in Your eyes?","Which of these two is better in the well founded path?","God said, He is superior who thinks better thoughts of me; the good thoughts of the sinner leave him not defiled.","You are a frowner not out of fear and religious aspiration, you are pale from envy or dark red from gloating.","Neither of these gets anywhere, they are proper only to the fire; woe to him in whom envy is rooted!","Let it go from your hand; cursed is it; whoever is enemy of the moon has only shadows.","Know for sure, O sun, that bats are your enemies, they are a disgrace to all birds, fellow-prisoners in brooding night.","The sun’s enemy is docked, that rank does not remain to him; how long shall the mote there remain if it falls into the eye?","Consorts of the Moon are your two Mars, which are those two eyes of yours, Darling; with that Harut and Marut of yours draw the litigious ones to Babylon.","Solomon, with that ring (for you are the sealing of all the fair ones) by force drag in chains all the divs and peris.","You have opened the treasure of beneficence for the sake of jinns and men; draw the likeness of We have given thee over the needy beggar.","Illumine the body with the spirit, root up envy utterly; fix the gaze on the orient skies, draw the reason into problems.","When the lip recites Praise, give it dessert and wine unli mited; when it recites Nor those astray, do you draw it into guiding proofs.","When the soul hurries towards you, give it a candle to find the way; when it seeks your sun, draw it like the moon into the houses.","Give the crop-sick lover the wine of Kai-Ka’us’ cup; draw before the thoughts of the man of reason hairsplitting and craft.","With the advancing of your favours draw the spirit and make it receptive; draw your acceptance and investiture towards the receptive soul.","To the prisoner of pain and regret give the message of Do not despair; draw him slain oflove for your beauty from this slayingplace to the slayer.","io If this body is infidel at heart, propose testimony to it; and if this spirit is fruitless, what matters that?","Draw it to the fruit.","Quicken it, and if you cannot, make Messiah your deputy; grant it union, or if you grant it not, draw it by your grace to the Lord of grace.","Earthy one, the earth trembled when it saw that holiness and purity; recite When it is shaken, draw the vision into trembling.","Make an end of it, ho, at once, for you are the King of State and Word; whoever proffers speech, do you draw a line over speech and speaker.","The fair one whom I am seeking with all my soul I do not see amongst those present here.","Where has he gone?","He is not amongst those present; I do not see any sign of him in this assembly.","I am casting my gaze in every direction and every place; I do not see any trace of his rose bower.","Moslems, where has he gone, that illustrious one whom I used to behold in the midst like a candle?","Speak his name; for whoever has spoken his name, his bones will not crumble in the tomb.","Blessed is the man who has kissed his hand; at the time of death his mouth has become sweet.","Shall I give thanks for his countenance, or his character?","For the world beholds none his like.","If earth does not find his form, what matters it, seeing that his heaven revolves in this love?","Speak the nicknames of Shams al-DTn-i Tabriz; do not keep him concealed from the ears of the yearners.","Last night I went into the midst of the assembly of my king; i saw my soul in a beaker in the hand of the saki.","I said to him, O soul of the soul of the sakis, for God’s sake fill me a measure, and do not break your pledge.","Smiling sweetly he said, Noble sir, I do you service; I respect you by the right and respect of my faith.","He brought a cup and kissed it and placed it in my hand, full of wine shining like his own shining cheeks.","I prostrated before him and drew the bowl to me; the wine lighted a fire in me from its own brazier.","When the saki had poured continuously and dispensed for me many glasses after that wise, that wine like red gold transported me to its own quarry.","I saw my garden fresh and gay with the rose of his cheek; I saw my bread well baked with his hyacinthine brow.","Let every man find his own fortune and portion in a tavern; who am I?","I have found true sympathy to belong to me.","I saw Bu Lahab there biting hard his hand, Bu Huraira putting his hand in his own wallet; Bu Lahab was like the back (and no back sees the face), Bu Huraira turning his lace to his own moon and seventh heaven; Bu Lahab plunged in thought, seeking proof and demonstration, Bu Huraira his own proof and his own demonstration.","Not every jar is suitable for

all around me, but I am not of these four.","Now I am Turk, now Hindu, now Rumi, now Zangi; it is of your engraving, my soul, that I believe or disbelieve.","Tabriz, my heart and soul are with Shams-i Haqq here, even though in body I vex him no more.","I am a painter, a picture-maker, every moment I fashion an idol, then before you I melt away all the idols, I raise up a hundred images and mingle them with spirit; when I see your image, I cast them in the fire.","You are the vintner’s saki or the enemy of the sober, or the one who lays waste every house I build.","Over you the soul is poured forth, with you it is mingled; since the soul has the perfume of you, I will cherish the soul.","Every drop of blood that flows out of me says to your dust, I am one in colour with your love, I am the playmate of your affection.","In the house of water and clay this heart without you is desolate; either enter the house, O soul, or I will abandon the house.","I am your disciple, for all that I am stupid and twisted of mouth, so that I may learn one smile from your smiling lip.","Fountain of learning, do you want me for a pupil?","What device shall I invent to stitch myself to you?","At least I may descry through the crack of the door the lightning of your cheek; from that fire of the portico I will kindle a hundred candles.","One instant you rob me of my load on the way, saying, I am the tithe-collector; one instant you go before me, meaning, I am the guide.","Now you drive me to sin, now towards repentance; twist my head and my tail, for I am a compressed hamza.","In sin and in penitence, like a fish on the pan, this side and that side I am burning on the pan.","On your pan I am turning this way and that; in the darkness of night, with you I am brighter than day.","Enough, I am all diversified in craft and thought; for one instant like turquoise, for one instant like PIruz.","Once again, once again I have escaped from my chains, I have burst out of these bonds and this trap which seizes the infirm.","Heaven, the bent old man full of wizardry and deceit — by virtue of your youthful fortune I have escaped from this old man.","Night and day I ran, I broke away from night and day; ask of this sphere how like an arrow I sped.","Why should I fear sorrow?","For I am the comrade of death.","Why should I fear the general?","For I have escaped from the prince.","Reason bore me down with anxiety for forty years; sixty-two has made me quarry, and I have escaped from devising.","All creatures have been made deaf or blind by predestination; i have escaped from the attack and retreat of predestination, and from predestination.","Outwardly skin, inwardly stone, the fruit is a prisoner; like a fig, I have escaped from that skin and that stone.","Delay causes mischief, and haste is of the devil; my heart has escaped from haste, and I have escaped from delay.","In the first place blood was the food, in the end blood became milk; when the teeth of reason sprouted, I escaped from that milk; I ran after bread, a loaf or two, by imposture; God gave me a food, so that I escaped from imposture.","Be silent, be silent, speak no more in detail; I will speak of the interpretation, I have escaped from the stench of garlic.","Like a mirror my soul displays secrets; I am able not to speak, but I am unable not to know.","I have become a fugitive from the body, fearful as to the spirit; I swear I know not — I belong neither to this nor to that.","Seeker, to catch a scent is the condition of dying; look not upon me as living, for I am not so.","Look not on my crookedness, but behold this straight word; my talk is an arrow, and I am as a bow.","This gourdlike head on top of me, and this dervish habit of my body — whom am I like, whom am I like in this market of the world?","Then this gourd on my head, full of liquor — I keep it upside down, yet I let not a drop trickle from it.","And even if I do let trickle, do you behold the power of God, that in exchange for that drop I gather pearls from the sea.","My eyes like a cloud gather pearls from that sea; this cloud of my spirit rises to the heaven of fidelity.","I rain in the presence of Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz, that lilies may grow in the form of my tongue.","Said, my spirit is moving in the track of love, but because of your weariness my tongue is tied.","Like an arrow I am flying towards your joyous company; beloved, do not break my bow with cruelties.","Like a tent I remain standing before you on one loot; beloved, bring me into your tabernacle and seat me there.","Ho, lay that flagon’s lip on my dry lip, then hear the veritable magic from my mouth; Hear the story of Babylon and the tale of Va’il, for by way of meditation I travel the world.","Excuse me if my turbulence goes beyond bounds, since love grants me security not for a single moment.","When you are weary, I am weary of your weariness; when you wash your hands of me, I bite my fingers.","On the night when you dispense light like the moon until daybreak, in your wake I am running like a star; On the day when you put up your head from the east like the sun, like the sun I am altogether spirit.","But on the day when like the spirit you are hidden from my eyes, like the heart of a bird I am fluttering with anxiety.","On the day when your light shines through my window, in my apartment I dance for joy like a mote.","Rational soul, be silent and depart into hiding like the thought, so that he who thinks of causes only may not find my track.","I am the slave who set the master tree, I am the one who taught the teacher.","I am that soul which was born of the world yesterday, and yet erected the ancient world.","I am the wax whose claim is this, that it was I who made steel steel.","I have painted with surmeh many a sightless one, I have taught many a one without intelligence.","I am the black cloud in the night of grief who gladdened the day of festival.","I am the amazing earth who out of the fire of love filled with air the brain of the sky.","In joy that king slept not last night, because I the slave remembered him.","It is not to blame, since you intoxicated me, if I am scandalous and wrought injustice.","Silence, for the mirror is rusting over; when I blew upon it, it protested against me.","I made a journey, I ran to every city, no man I saw with your grace and beauty.","I returned from banishment and exile, once more I attained this felicity.","Since I became far from the garden of your countenance, I saw no rose, I plucked not one fruit.","Since by bad luck I fell far from you, I have endured trouble from every unlucky one.","What shall I say?","I was utterly dead without you; God has created me anew once more.","Amazing!","Would you say that I have beheld your face?","Would you say that I have heard your voice?","Suffer me to kiss your hand and loot; give festively, for today is festival.","Joseph of Egypt, I have brought you as a present such a bright mirror.","how close your soul is to my soul!","For whatever thing you are thinking, I know.","I have a token even closer than this; come close, and behold my token.","In dervish guise you come into the midst; do not jest and say, I am in the midst.","I am like the column amidst your house; I am like a waterspout hanging down from your roof.","I am a sharer of your secrets on the day of mustering and resurrection, I am not a passing host like worldly friends.","In your banquet I go round like the wine, in time of your batde I go before you like a lance.","If like lightning I make a trade of dying, like the lightning of your beauty I am without a tongue.","Always I am joyful; it makes no difference whether I yield my soul, or seize a soul.","If I give you my soul, it will be good trade, for in exchange for a soul you will give me a hundred worlds.","In this house thousands and more are dead; there you are seated saying, Behold my household!","A handful of dust says, I was once a tress; another says, I am a bone.","You become bewildered; then suddenly Love comes saying, {Come to me, for I am the one eternally alive.","Embrace my smooth breast to your breast, so that I may} deliver you this very instant from yourself."," Silence, Khusrau, speak no more of Shinn; my mouth is burning with sweetness.","Out of all the world I choose you alone; do you deem it right for me to sit sorrowful?","My heart is like a pen in your hand; through you it is, whether I am glad or grieve.","What shall I be other than what you wish?","What shall I see except what you show?","Now you cause thorns to grow from me, now roses; now I smell roses, now I pluck thorns.","Since you keep me so, I am so — since you wish me so, I am so.","In that vat where you dispense dye to the heart, what should i be?","What my love and hate?","You were the first, and you will be the last; do you make my last better than my first.","When you are hidden, I am of the infidels; when you appear, I am of the faithful.","What do I possess other than the thing you have given?","What are you searching for in my pocket and sleeve?","Come, for today we are the quarry of the King, we have no need for self and the world.","Come, for today like Moses son of ‘Imran {with manliness} we will lift up dust from the sea.","All night we were fallen like a staff; now that day has come we are restless as serpents.","Having circumambulated round our own breast, we bring out of the soul’s pocket the White Hand.","By that power whereby a serpent became a staff, every night we are like a staff, daily a serpent; For arrogant Pharaoh we are serpents, for Moses we are staves and obedient.","By zeal we shed the blood of Nimrods; do not regard the fact that we are slender as gnats.","We will exceed over lions and elephants, though in the hand of that Lion we are helpless.","Though like camels we are crooked of nature, like camels we travel smoothly towards the Kaaba.","io We will not attach our hearts to a two-days’ fortune, for we are successful in everlasting fortune.","Like sun and moon we are near and far, like love and the heart we are hidden and patent.","For the sake of blood-lapping, blood -devouring Love we are as blood in the platter of Love’s dogs.","As fish in the time of silence we are silent, in the time of speech we are the dustless moon.","I was intent on seeking a stratagem, that that moon-faced one might set his face on mine","I said, I have one word in my mind; come forward, that I may speak it in your ear.","Last night, dear soul, I saw a dream, and I desire to seek from you its interpretation.","I have none intimate with this dream but you; do you listen, my king whose habit is to conceal.","Fie moved his head and laughed — that head which knows me hair by hair — As if to say, You are hatching a trick to play on me, for I am the mirror of every hue and scent.","I am as a plaything in his hands, for I am the picture drawn by his gold-stitching needle.","Not lifeless shall be the image which he has made; I am his least image, I am therefore in ecstasy.","I departed, ridding the world of the trouble of my presence, I escaped from anguish with my life; I bade farewell to my companions, I transported my soul to the signless world.","I went forth from this house of six doors, gaily I carried my baggage to placelessness.","When I beheld the master of the hunt of the Unseen I flew like an arrow, carrying my bow; When the polo-stick of death approached me, I carried off from the midst the ball of felicity.","A marvellous moon shone through my window; I went to the roof, carrying a ladder.","The roof of heaven which is the assembly-place of souls, was fairer than I had ever imagined.","Since my rose-branch had become withered, I carried it back again to the garden and rosebower.","As there was no purchaser for my coin, I carried it quickly to the source of the source of the mine; From these counterfeiters I carried also as a present a filing of the soul to the goldsmith.","In the Unseen the boundless world I saw; to that bound I transported my tent.","Do not weep for me, for I am happy because of this journey, inasmuch as I have travelled the road to the realm of paradise.","Write this saying upon my tomb, that I have come safely out of trial and tribulation.","Sleep sweetly, body, in this earth, for I have carried your message up to heaven.","Bind up my chin, for I have carried all lamentations to the creator oflamentation.","Speak no more the grief of your heart, for I have carried your heart to the presence of Him who knows all secrets.","We are dancing like motes, we obey the command of your sun.","Every dawn out of Love’s east like the sun we rise.","We thresh about in dry and wet, we become not dry, nor turn wet.","We have heard brasses making much lament, O light, shine, that we may become gold.","For the sake of their need and anguish we rise to the spheres and the stars.","We come as amber for a necklace from the silver-bosomed beloved.","We have beaten our dervish frock, to emerge from that to a gown of Shushtar.","We are the drainers of pure wine on the path of poverty, we are intoxicated with the red wine","If they impose on us the world’s poison, we come as sugar out of our inward parts.","On the day when brave men flee, we come as Sanjar in the thick of the batde; We make wine of the foeman’s blood, then we drain it and come like daggers.","We are the ring of drunken lovers, every day we come as a ring on the door.","He wrote the sign-manual of security for us; how should we come to the rattle of mere death?","In the supernal kingdom and placelessness we come on the steed of the green sphere.","We went into hiding from the world of the flesh, we come more manifest in the world of Love.","In the body the soul has become pure; we become bodiless and come yet purer.","Shams-i Tabriz is the soul of the soul; we come shoulder to shoulder in the house of eternity.","Last night I vowed anew, I swore an oath by your life, That I would never remove my eyes from your lace; if You smite with the sword, I will not turn from You.","I will not seek the cure from any other, because my pain is of separation from You.","If You should cast me into the fire, I am no true man if I utter a sigh.","I rose from your path like dust; now I return to the dust of your path.","If I do not express in speech your elegance, I have your love within my breast.","If I smell a rose without your love, forthwith burn me like a thorn.","If I am silent as a fish, yet I am restless as the waves and the sea.","You who have set a seal on my lips, draw my toggle towards You.","What is your design?","What should I know?","I only know that i am in this train.","I chew the cud of grief for you like a camel, like a raging camel I bring up foam.","Though I keep hidden and do not speak, in the presence of love I am manifest.","I am like a seed under the soil, I am waiting upon the signal of spring, That without my own breath I may breathe sweetly, that without my own head I may scratch a head.","On the day when you pass over my grave, bring to mind this terror and confusion of mine; Fill full of light that bottom of the tomb, O eye and lamp of my light, That in the tomb this patient body of mine may prostrate to you in gratitude.","Harvest of roses, pass me not in haste, make me happy a moment with that perfume; And when you pass by, do not suppose that I am far from your window and portico.","If the stones of the tomb have blocked my way, I am unwearying on the path of fantasy.","Though I should have a hundred winding-sheets of satin, I am naked without the vestment of your form.","I will emerge into the hall of your palace, in breaking a hole in the wall perchance I am like an ant.","I am your ant, you are Solomon; not for one moment leave me without your presence.","I have fallen silent; do you speak the rest, for I am shunning henceforth my own speaking and listening.","Shams-i Tabriz, do you invite me, since your invitation is my blast of the trumpet.","We are living by the light of Majesty, we are strangers and exceeding familiar.","The carnal soul is like a wolf, but in our secret heart we are superior to Joseph of Egypt.","The moon repents of his conceit when we display to him out face; The feathers and pinions of the sun consume when we open our feathers and pinions.","This form of man is a veil; we are the qibla of all prostrations.","Regard that breath, do not see the Adam in us, that we may transport your soul with grace.","Iblis looked with a separate regard, he supposed that we are apart from God.","Shams-i Tabriz himself is the pretext; it is we who are in the beauty of grace, we.","For the sake of a veil say to men, He is the noble king and we are beggars.","io What have we to do with kingship and beggary?","We are happy because we are worthy of the king.","We are effaced in the beauty of Shams-i Tabriz; in that efface ment neither he is, nor are we.","O world of water and clay, since I knew you I have known a myriad tribulations and pains.","You are the pasturage of asses, not the abode of Jesus; why have I known this pasturage of asses?","You first spread the table, then gave me sweet water; you bound me hand and foot, so that I knew hand and foot.","Why should you not bind hand and foot, seeing God called you a cradle?","Like a tree I lift up my hands from the earth in desire for that one from whom I knew desire.","O cluster, how is it that in childhood you become like a perfect old man?","Answer came, I escaped from youthful passion when I knew the zephyr.","The branch goes upwards because it came from above; I hasten towards my origin, because I know my origin.","How long shall I speak of below and above?","Placelessness is my origin, I am not of place, for I know whence place comes.","No, be silent, depart into nonexistence, become naught in nonexistence; behold, how I know things from no-things!","Since my sun and star arose higher than form, I am happier to go from realities into realities.","I have become lost in realities — so it is sweeter; I will not return towards form, I will not look upon the two worlds.","I am melting in meanings till I become of one colour with him, for meaning is as water and I am as sugar.","No man’s heart wearies of the life of his own soul; naturally in view of this reality I will not recall form.","I stroll from garden to garden with the spiritual ones, graceful as a red rose and fresh as a nenuphar am I.","I am as a wave to the body’s boat, I break it plank by plank; I smash myself when I am anchor to myself.","And if out of hardness of heart I am slack in my affairs, swifriy out of the sea surge my flames of fire","I am laughing happily as gold amidst his fire, because if I emerge from the fire I congeal as gold.","From an incantation like a snake I have put down my head on his line — brother, what will fall on my head from his line?","I was weary of form, I came towards attributes; each attribute said, Enter here, for I am the green sea.","Shams-i Tabriz, I have a realm like Alexander; consequently out of grace I am army-leader towards the armies of meaning.","Give me that last night’s wine, for I am intoxicated by your potion; Hatim of the world, give into my hand a huge cup.","Saki of true men, turn not your face from me for one moment; do not break my heart, else I shall break cup and glass.","A cup was in my hand, I flung it down and broke it; I wounded the soles of a hundred naked feet with that glass.","You are a glass-worshipper because your liquor is from glass; my wine is not of must, so why should I worship glass?","Drink, my heart, the spiritual wine, and sleep secure and free of care; for I have beheaded anguish, I have escaped from sorrow and anguish.","My heart has gone up, my body has gone down; where am I, the helpless one?","I am neither above nor below.","What a fine hanging apple am I, who cannot endure without your stone!","How should I endure without bala if I am drunk with alcist","Ask of me, what a treasure this love is and what it holds; ask concerning me also of him, that he may say who I am.","Why do you hang about the riverbanlc?","Leap from the river, if you are a true man; leap from the river and seek for me, for I have leaped from the river.","io If you remain, we remain, and if you go, we depart; when you ate I ate, when you sat I sat.","I am that drunken drummer who went drunk into the arena, i tied my drum like a flag to the top of my lance.","What a happy and unselfed king you are!","Ho, silent as a fish — since I have escaped from being, why do you draw me back to being?","I am that lover of your love who have no occupation but this, for I have nothing but disapproval for him who is not a lover.","I seek no heart but yours, I hurry only towards you; I do not smell the roses of every garden, I have no heed for every thorn.","In you I have put my faith, my heart has become Mussulman; my heart said to you, Darling, I have no beloved like you.","Since you are my eye and tongue, I do not see two, I do not recite two, I acknowledge none but the one darling that is you.","Since I drink of your honey, why should I sell vinegar?","Why should I labour for my daily bread?","It is not the case that I do not possess an ample allowance.","I eat to my fill at this table of the Sultan’s sugarcakes, not as a guest of Satan; I have no appetite for lunch.","I will not grieve, I will not grieve, I will not boast of asceticism; if you think I have not abundant gold, behold my goldpale cheeks.","The Khusrau of the heart grieves only for Shinn; with what heart should I grieve?","After all, I have not a grieved heart.","I would explain for all, both fearful and secure alike; but I have not the heart to speak of inward words, io You who are unbranded by madness, tell me now, how are you?","For I have no further traces of how and after what manner.","Since from Tabriz has come the moon of Shams al-Haqq u din to me, I have no care for the moon of the dormitory of the commander.","If I am hand-clapping, I belong not to the clappers; I am neither of this nor of that, I am of that mighty city.","I am not for fluting and gambling, I am not for wine and liquor, I am neither leaven nor crop-sickness, I am neither like this nor like that.","If I am drunk and dissolute, I am not drunk with wine like you; I am not of earth nor of water, I am not of the people of time.","The mind of the son of Adam — what knowledge has it of this utterance?","For I am hidden by two hundred veils from the world entire.","Hear not these words as from me, nor from this clear thought, for I neither receive nor seize this outward and inward.","Though your face is beautiful, the cage of your soul is of wood; run away from me or you will burn, for my tongue is a flame.","I am not of scent nor colour, I am not of fame nor shame; beware of my poplar arrow, for God is my bow.","I seize not raw wine, nor borrow from anyone, I seize neither breath nor snare, O my youthful fortune.","I am as the rosebower of paradise, I am the joy-garden of the world, for my spirit is flowing through the spirits of all men.","The sugarbed of your phantom brings rose-sugar to me; in the garden of realities I scatter the rose of a hundred petals.","When I enter the rose-showering garden of union with you, make me sit down, for I am a target for your brand.","Love, what a mate you are, how strange, how marvellous!","When you seized my mouth, my expression went inwards.","When my soul reaches Tabriz, to come to Shams al-Haqq u din, I will bring to an end all the secrets of speech.","There is a passion in my head that I have no inclination for mankind, this passion makes me so that I am unaware of myself.","The king oflove bestows every moment two thousand kingdoms; I desire nothing from him save his beauty.","The girdle and cap of his love are enough for me in both worlds; what matter if my cap falls?","What care if I have no girdle?","One morning his love transported my wounded heart to a place where I transcended day and night, and have no knowledge of dawn.","A journey befell my soul to the kingdom of realities, such that the sky and the moon say, I have no such journey.","through separation if my soul scatters pearls from my eyes, think not that I have not a heart full of pearls from him.","What sugar-seller have I to sell sugar to me!","Never on any day he said, Go, for I have no sugar.","I would have shown a token of his beauty, but the two worlds would be confounded; I have no inclination for such clamour and riot.","Tabriz, I have sworn that after Shams-i Din comes I will in gratitude lay down this head, for I have nothing but a head.","The ravings which my enemy uttered I heard within my heart; the secret thoughts he harbored against me I also perceived.","His dog bit my foot, he showed me much injustice; I do not bite him like a dog, I have bitten my own lip.","Since I have penetrated into the secrets of individuals like men of God, why should I take glory in having penetrated his secret?","I reproach myself that through my doubtings it so happened that purposely I drew a scorpion towards my own foot.","Like Iblis who saw nothing of Adam except his fire, by God I was invisible to this insignificant Iblis.","Convey to my friends why I am afflicted in mind; when the snake bit my thigh I started away from the black rope.","The blessed silent ones, their lips and eyes closed — by a way unknown to any man, I ran into their thoughts; Since there is a secret and perfect way from heart to heart, I gathered gold and silver from the treasuries of hearts.","Into the thought that was like a brazen stove I flung the dead dog; out of the thought that was like a rose bower I plucked roses and jasmine.","If I have hinted at the evil and good of my friends, I have spun that like a weaver as the choicest veil.","When my heart rushed suddenly to a heart mighty and aware, out of awe for his heart I fluttered like the heart.","As you are happy with your own state, how did you fall in with me?","Attend to your own business, for I am neither shaikh nor disciple.","As far as you are concerned, brother, I am neither copper nor red gold; drive me from your door, for I am neither lock nor key.","Take it as if I had not ever spoken these words; if you had been in my mind, by God I would not have quarreled.","I closed my eyes to creation when I beheld his beauty, I became intoxicated with his beauty and bestowed my soul.","For the sake of Solomon’s seal I became wax in all my body, and in order to become illumined I rubbed my wax.","I saw his opinion and cast away my own twisted opinion; I became his reed pipe and likewise lamented on his lip.","He was in my hand, and blindly I groped for him with my hand; I was in his hand, and yet I inquired of those who were misinformed.","I must have been either a simpleton or drunk or mad that fearfully I was stealing from my own gold.","Like a thief I crept through a crack in the wall into my own vine, like a thief I gathered jasmine from my own garden.","Enough, do not twist my secret upon your fingertips, for I have twisted off out of your twisted fist.","Shams-i Tabriz, from whom comes the light of moon and stars — though I am grieving with sorrow for him, I am like the crescent of the festival.","Reason says, I will beguile him with the tongue; Love says, Be silent.","I will beguile him with the soul.","The soul says to the heart, Go, do not laugh at me and yourself.","What is there that is not his, that I may beguile him thereby?","He is not sorrowful and anxious and seeking oblivion that I may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure.","The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should beguile the shaft of his gaze with a bow.","He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold and the kingdom of the world.","He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful that I should beguile him with women.","Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how should I beguile him with such a form and likeness?","He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread?","He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world that I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss.","He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter sighs, to beguile him with lamentation.","I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering.","Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’s hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden.","He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry.","The glory of the unseen form is too great for me to beguile it with blessing or Paradise.","Shams-i Tabriz, who is his chosen and beloved — perchance I will beguile him with this same pole of the age.","My mother was fortune, my father generosity and bounty; I am joy, son of joy, son of joy, son of joy.","Behold, the Marquis of Glee has attained felicity; this city and plain are filled with soldiers and drums and flags.","If I encounter a wolf, he becomes a moonfaced Joseph; if I go down into a well, it converts into a Garden of eram.","He whose heart is as iron and stone out of miserliness is now changed before me into a Hatem of the age in generosity and bounty.","Dust becomes gold and pure silver in my hand; how then should the temptation of gold and silver waylay me?","I have an idol such that, were his sweet scent scattered abroad, even an idol of stone would receive life through joy.","Sorrow has died for joy in him of may God bind your consolation; how should not such a sword strike the neck of sorrow?","By tyranny he seizes the soul of whom he desires; justices are all slaves of such injustice and tyranny.","What is that mole on that face?","Should it manifest itself, out of desire for it forthwith maternal aunt would be estranged from paternal [uncle].","I said, If I am done and send my story, will you finish it and expound it?","He answered, Yes.","When I am asleep and crumbling in the tomb, should you come to visit me, I will come forth with speed.","You are for me the blast of the trumpet and the resurrection, so what shall I do?","Dead or living, wherever you are, there am I.","Without your lip I am a frozen and silent reed; what melodies I play the moment you breathe on my reed!","Your wretched reed has become accustomed to your sugar lip; remember wretched me, for I am seeking you.","When I do not find the moon of your countenance, I bind up my head [veil myself in mourning]; when I do not find your sweet lip, I gnaw my own hand.","The time has come for us to become madmen in your chain, to burst our bonds and become estranged from all; To yield up our souls, no more to bear the disgrace of such a soul, to set fire to our house, and run like fire to the tavern.","Until we ferment, we shall not escape from this vat of the world — how then shall we become intimate with the lip of that flagon and bowl?","Listen to true words from a madman: do not suppose that we become true men until we die","It is necessary that we should become more inverted than the tip of a comb in the top of the twisted tress of felicity; Spread our wings and pinions like a tree in the orchard, if like a seed we are to be scattered on this road of annihilation.","Though we are of stone, we shall become like wax for your seal; though we be candles, we shall become a moth in the track of your light.","Though we are kings, we shall travel straight as rooks for your sake, that we may become blessed through your queen on this chessboard.","In the face of the mirror of love we must not breathe a word of ourselves; we must become intimate with your treasure when we are changed to waste.","Like the tale of

milk, he whose quarry I am would have become my quarry.","Blaclc-faced night is then not the mate and consort of my day; stonyhearted autumn follows not in the wake of my springtide","Will you not be silent?","How long will you beat this drum?","alas, my veiled lip, that you have become veil-rending!","Suddenly today the enemy of my penitence and patience approached me midway on the road and cherished me like a king.","Seizing a cup like any drunkard, in it a hundred blandishments and charms, he held before me the wine cup, saying, If you are a winebibber, take.","Illumined as the face of Moses, blessed as Mount Sinai, gleaming as the White Hand, dilated with joy as the heart of ‘Imran.","Ho, come take this clean tablet from this Moses; be not arrogant like Pharaoh, contend not like Haman.","I said to him, Moses, what is in your hand?","He said, One time this is a staff, one time a serpent.","From every separate atom a hundred various shapes appear; for whatever is necessary for Bu Huraira is in the bag.","In my hand is the control of it, I change it into every form; I make poison into medicine, I make the difficult easy.","Now I strike it on the sea and bring up dust from

the black beetle; sugary syrup is fatal to the bilious.","Apparently all seekers are fellow travelers; in reality they are back to back.","One has made his lodging in the lowest depths, the other in the highest heaven.","Like a child and an old man, though apparently fellow travelers, one is increasing every day, the other every moment on the decline.","What a cup of poison and candy is this!","What magic and jugglery!","This turn and this revolution keep you giddy.","The world is fixed and you see it as revolving; when a man’s head is spinning, he sees the house as spinning.","Know as a station of fear that in which you are secure; know as a station of security that in which you tremble.","Since you are contrary and false you see everything contrariwise; foolish man, when you consult a woman, oppose her!","That one is a woman whose road and qibla is color and scent; truly woman is the evil-commanding soul in human form.","The counsel of the spiritual is like the buzzing of bees; from its lip it fills the floor of the house to the attic with its sweets.","Bravo the incomprehensible comprehended, bravo the familiar stranger, bravo the sourness better than sweet, bravo the unbelief better than faith!","Be silent, for the tongue has become a door keeper from measuring words; when the heart speaks without words, it occupies the high throne like a king.","Shine, Shams-i

the light, or the window?","Has perchance the end of the thread become lost?","What has become of that past state?","In that state the tip of the needle does not remain hidden.","Happy the moment when the farrash of we spread within this mosque pours oil from the olive of God into this lantern of the heart!","Heart, enter the crucible of fire, sit there quietly like a man, for through the influence

out of this tumult into this passion, what will you do with this heart?","Come, sit here and tell me.","If out of unmanliness you do not enter the ring of true men, be outside like a ring on men’s door and knock.","Since the prophet said Fasting is a protection, lay hold of that, do not cast away this shield before the arrow-shooting carnal soul.","On this dry land a shield is necessary; when you reach the sea, then there will grow on your body a coat of mail like a fish to repel his shafts.","It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon one another, to fight and squabble and make tumult.","The lover is worse then the drunkard; the lover also belongs to that party.","I will tell what love is; it is to fall into a goldmine.","What may that gold be?","The lover is the king of kings; it means becoming secure from death and not caring for the golden crown.","The darvish in his cloak, and in his pocket the pearl — why should he be ashamed of begging from door to door?","Last night that moon came along, having flung his girdle on the road, so drunken that he was not aware that his girdle had fallen.","I said, Leap up, my heart, place wine in the hand of the soul; for such

beneficence","His impossibility comes to pass, his insalubriousness is a bonus, his injustice is all rectitude.","Calumny from him is justice.","His hard is soft, his synagogue is the Kaaba, the Beloved’s thorn is better than roses and basil.","The moment when he is bitter is better than a sweetshop, and the moment when he becomes weary, that is kissing and embracing.","The moment when he says to you, By Allah, I am indifferent to you — that is the water of Khidar from the fountain of life.","The moment when he says No, in his No are a thousand Yeses; his strangerhood is kinship according to the code of the unselfed.","His infidelity becomes all faith, his stone all coral, his miserliness all beneficence, his crime all forgiveness.","If you criticize, you say, You have a crooked way of going on; I have bought the way of his brow and given my life.","I am drunk with this crooked way; I have made enough, and closed my lips — rise up, bright heart, and recite the rest of it.","Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz!!","Dear Lord, what sugar you sprinkle!","You might say that out of my mouth proceed a hundred proofs and demonstrations.","Become placeless in the Unity, make your place

if it be so that you take up residence, let it be in the green dome of heaven.","io Be like the sufferer from dropsy who is never satiated; however high you get, strive to rise still higher.","Every spirit that has an aim keeps his face to the door; you aim at this madness, so turn your head towards madness.","The body is not without a shadow, and the shadow cannot be bright; fly towards the window and make your flight unaccompanied.","Following Majnun’s rule, be an agent of turmoil, for this love is declaring, Make yourself quit of reason!","Become at once a burning fire, and become roasted and wellbrowned; become at once drunk and wine, seize fast without either.","Become at once secretive and intimate, be silent and become companion; at once become us and become ours, likewise

face, press your lips on mine.","Close the door of speech and open the heart’s window; you will not obtain a kiss of this moon save by way of the window.","A call came to the soul from the sphere of the Pleiades: Come up, do not sit below like the dregs.","No one remains so long on a journey apart from his homeland and former friends.","Well, you have heard the call, Return from that king and

bond is there between money-changer and counterfeiter?","What relation is there between crow and falcon?","Why do you adorn with plaster a ruin which above is covered with paintings and beneath is a prison?","Why do you not adorn your soul with wisdom?","For its every word is worth a hundred Chinas and Machins; That wisdom which is the source of disputation is not that wisdom which causes the soul to see God.","io Become a jewel so that willy-nilly they will plant you altogether on the golden crown.","Be done with going back like a twisted foot; be as alif sit single and upright.","Since meaning is a horse and words are as a saddle, say, how long will you draw along this saddle without the horse?","Throw clods at the love of men; you too are a man, but a man of clay; The wedding of

bowstring?","You are a bow, you must bend to the string.","Why do you kick up your hind legs saying, I have escaped the load?","I have merely let you go for a moment to graze.","In fear and awe of me the sea’s heart surges with billows and throbbing.","If the rocky mountain should encounter that blow, it would not be able to leap out of my chains.","Until my command says to heaven, Enough, it must go on spinning around my earth.","io Desire is a milk from the teats of Satan; your reason is to suck asses’ milk.","Earth’s mouth is dry out of despair for me, without me it cannot swallow a single mouthful.","Who is able to attack my quarry?","Who is able to purchase my slave?","He whom I have seized and chosen, whom shall he choose other than me?","The soul has no security save in love; it is

because the shepherd is cruel.","This shepherd will not shed the blood of the sheep, for he knows to rear them to eternal life.","Know that the companions of the body are the Companions of the Elephant; how can such ever reach the Kaaba?","For the Kaaba is the world’s navel, the elephant is the nose; it is not possible to draw the nose to the navel.","Become as ababil, and do not flee from

a journey; See how everyone desirous of his own sustenance has bowed his head before his king.","See how, like the stars, for the sake of its glow, are all fallen helpless at the foot of the sun; See how, like forrents in quest of water, all are tumbling headlong towards their sea.","See how for each from the king’s kitchen a table is prepared according to his needs.","See how the sea of the world is contracted before their seadrinking cup.","And as for those whose sustenance is the king’s countenance, see how their mouths are filled with sugar of the king’s beauty.","Behold with the eyes of Shams-i Tabnzi, see another ocean filled with pearls.","This is love: to fly to heaven, every moment to rend a hundred veils; At first instance, to break away from breath — first step, to renounce feet; To disregard this world, to see only that which you yourself have seen.","I said, Heart, congratulations on entering the circle of lovers, On gazing beyond the range of the eye, on running into the alley of the breasts.","Whence came this breath, O heart?","Whence came this throbbing, O heart?","Bird, speak the tongue of birds: I can heed your cipher!","The heart said, I was in the factory whilst the home of water and clay was abaking.","I was flying from the workshop whilst the workshop was being created.","When I could no more resist, they dragged me; how shall I tell the manner of that dragging?","That enemy of soul and mind and faith has returned, shaking his sleeves — Plunderer of a hundred thousand houses, devastator of a hundred thousand shops, Stirrer-up of a hundred thousand tumults, amazement-locus of a hundred thousand amazed ones, That nurse of reason and bane of reason, that friend of the soul and enemy of the soul.","Whither will he transport my light reason?","He seeks a reason like that of Luqman.","How does he accept my worthless soul?","He seeks a soul like the sea of Oman.","He came, saying, Bring the tribute of the village!","I said, What village?","It is a ruined village.","Your flood has shattered cities; how shall a village stand amid the flood?","He said, Ruins are the abode of treasures; it is our ruin, O muslim!","Give us the ruin, or go forth; do not upbraid, do not speak at random.","The ruin is of yourself; once you have gone it thrives through the justice of the King.","Do not dissemble and say I have gone; do not hide behind the door.","Make yourself as one dead, that you may become living by the spirit of a man.","You said, You shall not be in the midst; that saying of yours is the essence of Koran.","The work you do, yourself not in the midst, that is work done by God — know this for sure.","I will recite the rest of the poem in secret; it cannot be told before the uninitiated.","Silence!","For there are a hundred thousand differences between the tongue’s utterance and the light of revelation.","Do not grieve over any joy that has gone forever, for it will return to you in another form, know that for sure.","Did not the child find joy in its nursing and in milk?","When the child was weaned from milk, the joy came from wine and honey.","This joy is an unqualified thing which enters various forms, moves from box to box between water and clay; It suddenly displays its grace in the water of the rain, again enters into the rosebed, and lifts its head from the earth.","Now it comes by water, now by way of bread and meat, now by way of beauty, now by way of horse and saddle.","From behind these veils suddenly one day it peeps and shatters all the idols, that which is neither that nor this.","The soul in sleep leaves the body and appears in a phantasm; the body is deposed and idle — in another form it is manifest.","You might say, In a dream I saw myself like a cypress, my face as a bed of tulips, my body as roses and jasmine.","That phantasm of the cypress vanished, the soul returned to its house; verily in this and that is a warning to all beings.","I fear stirring up trouble, though I would have spoken what may be spoken, God speaks fairer than I — do not let go of the saddlestraps of the faith.","Fa Hldtun fa Hldtunfd ‘ildtun fa e ildt, if you have not goldwheat bread, yet speak the golden words.","At last, Tabriz of the soul, look upon the stars of the heart, that you may see this mundane sun to be a reflection of Shams-e din.","My king of moonfaced ones went up to his sick lovers, saying, O pale cheeks and saffronbed of mine!","I will water my saffronbed, I will convert the saffron to roses with my fountain of life.","Yellow and red, thorn and rose are at my control and command; set not your head save on the line of my command, my command!","The world’s rosefaced ones have stolen beauty from my beauty; they have stolen an atom of my beauty and beneficence.","In the end these moonfaced ones are becoming strawfaced; that is the state of thieves in the presence of my King.","Day has come; earthly ones, restore the stolen goods.","O my soul, whence come goods for earthly man, and whence beauty?","When at night the sun has vanished, the stars make boast.","Venus says, Know it is mine; the moon says, No, mine.","Jupiter produces Ja‘far gold from his purse; Mars says to saturn, See my cutting dagger!","Mercury takes the high seat — I am the Sadr al-Sudur, the heavens are my kingdom, the zodiacs are my pillars!","io With dawn the sun draws up his army from the east saying, Thieves, where have you gone?","See, it is mine!","Venus is terrified, the moon’s neck is broken; Mercury has become dry and cold with my shining face.","The business of Mars and Saturn is ruined by our light; Jupiter is bankrupt, saying, Alas, my purse is gone!","When the sun had run afield, came a cry, Ho, mannerless one, get out of my field!","I am the sun of the sun: sun, depart!","Sink into the well of the west: enter my prison.","At dawn lift your head from the {grave} of the east and come to life; make the deniers of the resurrection aware of my proof.","Every man’s festival is the month [moon] to which he is a sacrifice; your festival is my month [moon], you who are a sacrifice to me!","When Shams-i Tabrlzl shone from the House of not-of-theEast, the glow of his essence surpassed my bounds and potentialities.","The intellectual is all the time engaged in showing off; the lover is all the time becoming unselfed and distraught; Intellectuals are running away, afraid of drowning; the whole business and trade oflovers is drowning in the sea.","Intellectuals find repose by contriving repose; lovers think it a shame to be attached to repose.","The lover will be in a circle, alone from everyone, just as oil and water, though in the same place, are separate.","The man who goes to the trouble of offering advice to lovers gets nothing for his pains but to be a mockery of passion.","Love has the scent of musk, it is therefore notorious; how can musk escape from such notoriety?","Love is like a tree, and lovers are the shade of that tree; though the shade fall afar, yet it must attend the tree.","For the station of intellect a child must become an old man; in the station of love you see an old man become youthful.","Shams-i TabrizI, whoever has chosen to be lowly in love for you, thereby rises to heights sublime as your love.","Saki, now that you are drunk, fling yourself on me; to recollect tomorrow is credit — smite the neck of credit.","The year is our year, and the ascendant is the ascendant of Venus and the moon; O heart, this pleasure and joy has no bounds — be at rest.","Glow and gaiety have penetrated to the heart of stone and steel; if you do not believe, strike the stone upon the steel.","Look at the host, see the happiness upon his face; sit at this table and dip your bowl in the oil.","Summon up nimble reason and seat it beside happiness; jovially apply your bright soul to bright wine.","The branches are drunk and dancing in the wind of spring; jasmine, be drunk, and cypress, stroke the lily.","They have cut green garments at the shop of the unseen; tailor, rise up, sit at your shop, stick in your needle.","What light is that in the midst of the darkness of your soul?","A royal splendor is shining in my heart — who is that?","It appears that it is the fantasy of the king’s moonlike face, that it is the succoring shelter of the day of misery.","All this splendor and beauty and grace and loveliness and charm is the Pride of Souls, Shams-i Haqq-i Dln-i Tabriz!.","The human soul cannot endure the clear exposition of his qualities; all that it can endure of his qualities, my heart, is by allusion.","For how should eternal qualities display themselves in mortality to a mixture which itself is of the mortal world?","How far does that beauty, which God engraved of His own hand, transcend an image created by Azar or Mam!","The eye that has beheld him, and then looked on another than him, must be stoned, lor it is worthless.","O heart, in loverhood abandon your good name, for the beginning of love is notoriety and evil fame.","In the sea of his love the soul’s clothes are an embarrassment; to seek in love lor name and bread is rawness, my heart.","Even the love of the generality of people has this specialty, my heart; all the more especially this love which belongs to that lofty assembly.","Zephyr, bring the earth of Tabriz as a present for my sake, for in preciousness it compares with a jewel of the quarry.","Lover, open your two eyes and behold in yourself tour streams — a stream of water, a stream of wine, streams of milk and honey.","Lover, look into yourself, do not be a laughingstock of men, so that So-and-so says this, and So-and-so says that.","I am the slave of that all-seeing rose which is indifferent whether So-and-so calls it thorn, or So-and-so calls it jasmine.","Then open your eyes henceforward, walk not with the eyes of men, that So-and-so says you are a Guebre and So-and-so a man of true religion.","God of his generosity gave you the eye of vision, to whose languidness the pinion of Gabriel prostrates.","Bandage not the narcissus-eye, and take not the vulture-eye; bandage not the first eye, and look not with the squint-eye.","Lovers of form have fallen into form, like the fly which falls from honey into a vat of whey.","Rejoice, you who play at love with the eternal Almighty; with such wings, why should you sorrow over water and clay?","If you desire that Gabriel should become your slave, be gone; prostrate before Adam at once, accursed div\ If the blood-drinking desert had knowledge of my Kaaba, on all sides a rose bower would appear, on all sides springwater.","You who continue to regard the evil and good of people, how is it you have become content with that?","May the Lord help you!","Since heaven itself had not the strength to bear God’s trust, how is it that Shams-i Tabriz!","has diffused it in the earth?","By God, I have no inclination towards either fat or sweet, nor for the purse full of gold, neither for the golden cup.","You draw the people of earth to heaven; the moon exclaims, What grace and generosity!","What amazing power and authority!","When your fantasy shines on me like the moon at the full, Venus and the Pleiades bite their forearms and fingers in envy.","Ha, thanks be to God that I have attained this kingdom; it was all true, what your love said to me again and again of old.","When he saw me on tiptoe, he signaled to me saying, What you desire has come to pass; ho, be secure and be seated!","All creatures in intoxication of joy bow down before him; lamb and wolf are friendly together, no envy or hatred in the heart; They are so drunk they cannot tell the way to town from the way home; they know not whether we are men, extraordinary, or colored clay.","Goblet in hand and distraught, I wonder what am I to do with this?","Drink it or bestow it?","You tell me, sweet king!","You drink; what bestowing should there be?","For your turn has come.","Lo, I have drunk; lo, I have drunk, since I am specified before you.","io Drink this wine of the throne, whereof if you were to place one cup in the hand of a dead man, he would respond to the prompting.","Beautiful one, by your roguish eye, signal with your eye; for one moment repair with a glance this your ruin.","Heart and soul, martyrs to your love, in the tomb of the body — pass along by the tomb of those martyrs, pay a pilgrimage.","You are come like a Joseph, all Egypt has cut its hands; display your charm and take my heart and soul, do a deal!","Or if you have stamped your foot tyrannically and sworn a vow, then break your vow — what matter?","Do expiation.","Say not, What profit shall I have from this offering of yours?","You need not profit; give, and take a loss!","Convert this saffronlike cheek into the like of roses and anemones; make a rejoicing heart out of three or four drops of blood.","Since fortune is your slave, it will never rebel against you; king, be an ambassador between us and fortune.","Since sins are as a straw before the mountain of your clemency, look with disdain upon our mountain of sins.","Our body was two drops of blood that became pure and human; you also cleanse the impure quality.","Since souls here become the prisoner of water and clay from the world of the spirit, deliver them from the clay, Abode of War, and make a raid!","Since I have repented of words, for the sake of the disciples instead of words issue a meaningful signal and command.","This firelike breath is for the sake of making warm; make a glow other than your breath a source of heat.","You who are King Shams-i Din, by the shining manifestation of yourself, make lovely Tabriz the abode of vision.","Since you deserted me death is for me joy and ease; without you, death has become for me like honey and milk.","The waterless fish quivers on that rough sand until its feeble soul may become parted from its body.","For the living ones, the water oflife has become the water of bitterness; pure sugar has become worse for them than the grave and winding-sheet.","It is no mere game, the drawing of the part to the origin, the all; how often the prophet wept for love of his homeland!","The child who does not know his homeland and birthplace desires a nurse; Istanbul or Yemen — they are all one to him.","The star goes to graze in the pasture of the skies; the animal worships earth, like cypress and jasmine.","Though I close my mouth to silence this lamentation, it is not possible to close one’s mouth in the belly of the water.","The frog’s breath is of water, not of the wind of the air; this is the custom and craft of sea creatures.","Gnostics who are hidden in that ocean oflight, their breath is all of darkness-shattering light.","When I reached this point, my pen and tablet broke; the mountain is shattered when it becomes aware of the Lord of grace","All have eaten and fallen asleep, and the house has become empty; it is time for us to saunter forth to the garden, To draw the skirt of the apple towards the peach, to carry a few words from the dewy rose to the jasmine.","Springtide is like the Messiah, it is all art, a spell, that the plant-martyrs may arise from their winding-sheets.","Since those fair idols opened their mouths in gratitude, the soul not attaining a kiss is drunk with the perfume of their mouths.","The glow on the cheeks of rose and tulip informs me that there is a lamp hidden in this place under the screen.","The leaf trembles on the twig, and my heart is trembling; the leaf trembles in the wind, my heart for the beauty of Khotan.","The hand of the zephyr has fanned the censor till it taught good manners to the children of the garden.","The breath of the Holy Spirit has encountered the trees of mary; see how husband and wife are playing with hands together [in joy]","The cloud, seeing the lovely ones beneath the canopy, scattered over them jewels and pearls of Aden.","Now that the red rose in joy has rent its skirt, the time has come for the shirt to reach Jacob.","Since the Yemeni carnelian of the Beloved’s lips laughed, the scent of God reaches Muhammad from Yemen.","We have spoken much at random, and our heart has not found repose save upon that scattered tress of the King of the time.","Wherever you set your toot, my darling, tulip and violet and jasmine spring up.","You breathe upon a piece of clay, and it becomes either a dove or a kite.","You wash your hands in a dish and from the water of your hand that basin becomes of gold.","You recite the Fdtiha over a grave and a Bu’l-Futuh raises his head from the winding-sheet.","Your skirt strikes against the clutch of a thorn, and its clutch becomes a strumming lute.","Every idol you have broken, O Abraham, receives life and finds intellect from that breaking.","Since the new moon shone upon an evil-starred one, it became the greatest good fortune and he escaped from misfortune.","Every moment there springs from the court of your breast a newborn without mother or father, like Adam.","And thereafter from his side and loins children abound in the earth.","I wanted to speak fifty couplets on this rhyme; I closed my lips, that you might open your mouth.","Elear the wordless subtleties, and understand what catches not the understanding.","Inside the stonelike heart of man is a fire which burns up the veil, root and branch; When the veil is burnt he discovers all the stories of Khidar and the knowledge from us.","Between the soul and the heart appears new and ever new forms from the ancient love.","When you recite By the sun behold the sun!","Behold the mine of gold when you recite Bam yakon.","Last night I saw Poverty in a dream, I became beside myself from its beauty.","From the loveliness and perfection of the grace of poverty I was dumbfounded until dawn.","I saw poverty like a mine of ruby, so that through its hue I became clothed in silk.","I heard the clamorous rapture of lovers, I heard the cry of Drink now, drink!","I saw a ring all drunken with poverty; I saw its ring in my own ear.","I saw many forms in the light of poverty, I saw many a form of the soul in its face.","From the midst of my soul a hundred surgings rose when I beheld the surging of the sea.","Heaven uttered a hundred thousand cries; I am the slave of such a leader.","Though long enough I have sat in fire up to my neck, now I am up to my neck in the water of union with the Beloved.","I said, I am immersed in your graces up to my neck.","The darling was not content with me up to the neck.","He said, Make your head a foot, descend into the depths oflove, for this affair does not come out right only up to the neck.","I said, My head, Beloved, is your shoe; only be content, my two eyes, with up to my neck this time.","He said, You are less than a thorn which was up to the neck in earth for nine months waiting for the rose.","I said, What is the thorn?","For the sake of your rosebed I have sat often in blood up to my neck like the rose.","He said, Through love you have escaped from the world of allurement, where you were struggling impotently up to your neck.","You escaped from the world, but not from yourself; your self-existence is a disgrace, and this disgrace is up to your neck.","Lay not traps cunningly, give up trickery; the trickmaster remains in his own trap up to the neck.","The trap of this world

the sun has laid his two cheeks on his cheeks, through his cheeks the moon on earth is checkmated.","In his tresses is the copy of Thee we serve; in his eyes the glance in Thee we beg for succor.","His body, like the body of a phantom, is without blood and veins; inside and outside it is all milk and honey.","Inasmuch as the Beautiful takes him into his embrace, he has carried away the scent of the Beloved and let go the scent of clay.","He is a morn without a dawn, an evening without henna, an essence without attributes, a life without sorrow.","How should the sun borrow light from the sky?","How should the rosebush borrow perfume from the jasmine?","Be speechless as a fish and pure as the water of the sea that you may quickly become the trustee over the treasury of the

gold; do not.","When you withdraw your lace, the moon is darkened with grief; you are intending the eclipse of the moon’s orb; do not.","Our lips become dry when you bring a draft: why are you wetting my eyes with tears?","Do not.","Since you cannot endure the shackling of lovers, why then do you dazzle the eye of reason?","Do not.","You do not give sweetmeats to one sick of a fever; you hurt still more him whose sickness you are; do not.","My lawless eye is the thief of your beauty.","Beloved, you requite the thievish eye; do not.","Withdraw, comrade, for it is no time for speech.","Why do you thrust yourself forward in the bewilderment of love?","Do not.","Give yourself a kiss, silvery- bodied idol; you who are in cathay, do not search for yourself in Khotan.","If you would draw a

is in the world, I am far and indifferent to it.","If he has given you sourness, to me he has given honey and sugar; he has made you jolting and lame, me smooth and even of pace","Whoever travels not on this road, his path is all gully and steep; I who am on this royal road am on a level path through him.","My heart is the Masjid-i Aqsd , my heart is the Paradise home; all my traces through him

happy with your stones and shards instead of gold.","A hundred skies revolve around your earth, a hundred full moons prostrate before your crescent moon.","With you our carnal soul’s dog plays foxy tricks, for the lion prostrates before your jackal.","Like day and night, footless we are journeying, O soul, since every moment from heaven arrives your Come up!","What shall be our darkness in the

street.","He was crying out from the house, I am here; we, heedless of this cry, go crying everywhere.","That drunken nightingale of ours is lamenting in our rose garden, like ringdoves we are flying

is nearer to you than you; why go outside?","Become like melting snow, wash yourself of yourself.","Through love a tongue grows in the soul like a lily; keep your tongue silent, imitate the trait of the lily.","From these depths depart towards heaven; may your soul be happy, journey joyfully.","You have escaped from the city full of fear and trembling; happily become a resident of the Abode of Security.","If the body’s image has gone, await the image-maker; if the body is utterly ruined, become all soul.","If your face has become saffron pale through death, become a dweller among tulip beds and Judas trees.","If the doors of repose have been barred to you, come, depart by way of the roof and the ladder.","If you are alone from friends and companions, by the help of god become a sdhib-qirdn [lord of happy circumstance].","If you have been secluded from water and bread, like bread become the food of the souls, and so become!","Sweetly parading you go — my soul of soul, go not without me; life of your friends, enter not the garden without me.","Sky, revolve not without me; moon, shine not without me; earth travel not without me, and time, go not without me.","With you this world is joyous, and with you that world is joyous; in this world dwell not without me, and to that world depart not without me.","Vision, know not without me, and tongue, recite not without me;

the fire in the shelter of the rose’s grace: you are the rose, I your thorn; go not into the rose garden without me","I run in the curve of your mallet when your eye is with me; even so gaze upon me, drive not without me, go not without me.","When, joy, you are companion of the king, drink not without me; when, watchman, you go to the king’s roof, go not without me.","Alas for him who goes on this

in that same moment there arrives to it the succor of your present.","No night nor dawntide has passed in the world, in which my breath has not been set afire by the threat of your watchman.","Did you not make a promise to me?","Did you not swear an oath, that at the time of my going up your ladder should arrive?","When you gaze on your servant with that narcissus eye, his soul flies from the place to your placelessness.","You cherish him saying, Sorrowful one, do not grieve henceforward, for heaven itself has thundered with your loud lamentation.","I am more compassionate in cherishing than mother and father; it was to mature you that your trial occurred.","I will make a garden, a Paradise, a cure out of your pain; out of your smoke I will fashion a new heaven better than this.","I have spoken all, yet I have not spoken the root of the matter, Beloved, for it is better that men should hear your secret from your own mouth.","Saki of the moonface, circulate the cup, deliver me out of

moon of god in the evening time.","It is not just that when I enter by the door, you should flee from me by the roof: You flee and I crying after you, Be patient one moment, O fleet of pace!","Moslems, Moslems, what remedy is there?","For I am consumed with fire, and yet this business is unsettled.","There is no remedy but pure wine in cups which noble men have circulated.","The tale of lovers has no end, so we will be satisfied with this, and so farewell!","The answer of Mutanabbl’s saying is this: A heart which wine cannot console.","There are a few dissolutes this side, hidden in the shade of the heart, and yonder sun shines from the roof of the heart upon their souls; Every star became a Venus, every mote a sun, sun and stars before them spinning like motes.","Reason and heart, gone astray, have carried all the souls to heaven; every one of them has become a Kai-Khusrau and a king without parasol and standard.","You have slain many a mount and gone around the world; journey into your soul, and behold a people become altogether soul.","With this divine benefaction, with this beauty and loveliness, see the command- worshippers absorbed in the command.","Their hearts are as mirrors, those rancorless hearts of theirs; their hearts like the field of the skies, a king entering the field.","Through their jubilees and ululations, their sugar-cracking lips, dessert and wine and that other thing have become cheap in our town.","If I were unselfed as last night and thought not of the disturbance, unselfed I would have spoken the rest of this; But lor now I close my mouth, because I am in pawn to myself, till the time when my heart has become drunk with him.","King of the kings of the soul, Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz — through him every soul has become a sea, every body a coral.","Lovers, lovers, I am mad; where is the chain?","Chain-rattler of the soul, your clamor fills the world.","You have forged another chain and flung it upon my neclc; you have galloped from heaven to waylay the caravan.","Rise, soul, from the world, fly from earth and earth’s plot; for our sake this forch is revolving in heaven.","He who is pained at heart, how shall his way be barred by rain and mud?","That man is quit of love for whom mountain has not become a mustard grain.","One day a hermaphrodite cried, saying, Wicked shepherd, why, that goat is biting me, he looked at me from the flock.","The shepherd said, He bites the hermaphrodite and perhaps slays him underfoot, but should that trouble a real man?","You have spoken well, said the other.","Where is your reason, if you speak?","Where your toot to go running, to go from dry land to sea and become secure from the earthquake?","Then you will become king of kings, enter the ternal kingdom, rise higher than the heaven, depart from this dunghill; Active like the Universal Reason, surging like a sea of honey, like the sun in Aries, like the moon in Virgo.","A hundred crows and owls and doves are making melody in your ears; if only this clamor were less, you would hear the sounds of the heart.","If you are a man of heart, become without heart; if you have reason, become mad, for this partial reason is becoming a stye in the eye of your love, So that the unseen form may arrive and draw you out of form — for this problem has become difficult through its tangled locks.","But on this road you must trail the skirt of joy because the stage is drenched with lovers’ blood.","Go, go, heart, with the caravan; go not alone on the stage because this pregnant age is giving birth to troubles; There you will be freed from pains, and go in the protection of God; go in the sea like a skiff.","Heart, you have gone; go without complaining.","When you have removed heart from soul, you have escaped from war and peace; you have become free and unconcerned with both shop and grain.","Your soul has escaped from anxiety, the road to dangers is barred; he who is attached to you, is always in forty day seclusion.","Since by day you have become secure from this uproarious rumi, by night too do not worry about this jangling Zangi.","Be silent, sweet of presence; saki, bind up your waterskin, because the waves are not contained in pitcher and flagon.","Happy-cheeked saki of mine, give the cup like pomegranate blossom; if for my sake you will not give for the sake of the heart of the Beloved.","Saki, you are the darling, you are the sick man’s cure; quick, give the draft of gladness and healing to the sick.","Pour wine out in this bowl, smite the neck of anxiety; now, do not break my heart, my heart and sweetheart, and give.","Open that tavern, abandon this rowdiness; give to the thirststricken lover from the vintner’s vat.","You are the soul of spring and garden, the glory of cypress and jasmine; now make no excuses, roguish idol, but give!","When you set foot on trickery and start away from the drunkards’ hands our enemy will rejoice; despite strangers, give!","Give not grief and sighing, open the way only to joy; a sigh proceeds from the wayless; open the way; give audience.","We are all intoxicated of the encounter, athirst for the bumper of immortality; as pawns, give robe and turban before the saki.","I am athirst of old, hot of heart and breast; break the beaker and cup, give much, without measure.","You are both moon and moonshine, I am the fish of this water; the moon cannot reach the fish, so give generously of the moonshine.","I am seeing a moon outside the eye in the eye, which neither eye has seen nor ear heard of.","I do not see tongue and soul and heart save without myself, from that moment that I stole a glance at that cheek.","Had Plato seen the loveliness and beauty of that moon, he would have become even madder and more distressed than I.","Eternity is the mirror of the temporal, the temporal the mirror of pre -eternity — in this mirror those two are twisted together like his tresses.","A cloud beyond the senses whose rain is all spirit; sprinkling on the dust of the body — what rains he has rained!","The moonfaced ones of heaven, seeing the picture of his face, have become ashamed before that beauty and scratched the back of their necks.","Posteternity took the hand of pre-eternity and took it towards the palace of that moon: having seen both, it laughed in jealous pride at the two.","About and around his palace what lions there are, roaring jealously, aiming at the blood of the self-sacrificing, adventurous men.","Suddenly the word jumped from my mouth, Who is that king?","Shams al-DTn king of Tabriz; and at those words my blood surged.","Undaunted you are coming from my breast into my sight, chanting a potent spell and confused stories.","With one breath you bring into whirling the heavens and firmament; what would one rotting perception be before your spell?","You wash away the sins of both worlds at a single penitence; why have you tightened my slip around your finger?","You have a Job in every corner, a Jacob on every side; love has broken their door and stolen their cloths from the house.","Parade forth to the cemetery and in that garden proclaim, Rise, ancient dead, dance, crumbled body!","At once the whole cemetery becomes populated like a city, all dancing, all happy, fate turning back from all.","I do not boast of this at random, I am not weaving a fantasy; i have seen this a hundred ways, I am not speaking of what I have not seen.","If anyone says, I have fled from the people, I have gone, say, He speaks the truth if his shirt is forn from behind.","Be silent; listen, speaker, to the sorrow of the beloved with the lover; the {object} of the quest is obstinate, so long as the questor is a seeker.","Suddenly, having eaten nothing and taken away nothing, I fell from the garden palace and pavilion into the depths of such a well.","The world was no festival for me; I beheld its ugliness, that yellow wanton puts rouge on her face.","How does rouge beautify that thorn of evil root?","That thorn which has sunk into every liver and kidney?","She came, that blind crone, with a crown of roses, her black ribbon let loose, having blackened her eyebrows with indigo.","Look not at her anklets, regard her black legs; puppetry is very pretty — when behind a screen!","Go, wash your hands of her, Sufi of well-washed face; shave your heart of her, man of the shaven head!","Unlucky and heavy of soul is he who seeks fortune from her; he is gone in bondage to greatness, and burns like a chip.","Come to our aid, Beloved, amongst the heavy-hearted, you who brought us into this wheel out of nonexistence.","Silence!","Speak only of that infinite one of sweet breath; how long will you make discourse of these numbered breaths?","O you whose soul had informed my soul of itself, your thought every moment has made an impression on your slave.","Whatever you think whatever enters your mind, that same instant that thing passes into your servant’s mind.","My soul has become occupied with your graceful airs; your guile in secret has wrought another thing.","Every morn the reed laments, remembering your lip; your love fills the mouth of the reed with candy and sugar.","Because of your moonlike face and your stature and waist, this soul of mine has made itself like the new moon.","When I make myself like a belt, perhaps you will come to my waist, O you whose eye you have fixed on me in wrath.","In wrath you gazed and turned my heart upside down, so that this wandering heart journeyed out of itself.","That stranger-beloved of mine has returned to the house; today gaze about and behold strange forms!","See the faithful friends, see the brethren of purity, dancing because that treasure has returned to the ruin.","eye, behold the garden; ear, gather the words, open your sweet lips, beloved of fair legend.","Saki today unsparingly pour the immortal wine; what does the sea diminish through those two or three measures?","Measure and measure in wine is not duality, if you want it to become one, break the two measures.","am a falcon of the hunt, beloved, do not keep me in bonds; i will be no more like an owl in a ruin.","I am not content with you, patience has strayed from my heart; go, speak to another, I will not listen to your fable.","I am a grain of the skies, for a while I am in this earth; when the justice of spring comes the grain becomes green.","You are the bane of birds; of that grain which you know, you scatter a handful from a garner full of grain.","You who have given me lustre a hundredfold like the blue sky, beloved, answer frankly, is this so or not?","Beloved, once more shake the chain and from afar gaze upon the madmen.","This is the very rose bower of fortune, Lord, what a tree is this!","A hundred drunken nightingales every moment make their nest here.","The soul comes, being dragged by the ear; the heart comes to the lovely ones, because spring has come and that stranger december has gone.","Every day is festival and Friday for the poor; has not yesterday’s Friday become an ancient festival?","O soul, robed in festive garb like the festival moon, made of the light of the beauty of yourself, not of woolen frock; Like reason and faith sweet outside and inside, not garlic stuffed in the heart of a walnut-sweet.","Put on such a frock and go about in this ring, like the heart clear and bright in the vestibule of the heart.","On a running river, O soul, how shall a straw stand still?","How can rancor make its dwelling in the soul and spirit?","In the eye of sanctity these words are a branch new and fresh; in the eye of sensual perception, they are like an ancient legend.","O formless Beloved of the pure form-fashioner, O you who have given the cup full of tumult to the lovers, You have closed your mouth against uttering secrets, and opened in the heart the door which I do not mention.","Since your beauty secretly cast off the veil, heart has gone after saki and head after wine.","In the morning when your image drove forth riding, holy spirits, as numerous as the sands, followed on foot; And those who are famous in heaven for their adoration broke their rosaries and pawned their prayer rugs.","The soul cannot endure to gaze on your face unveiled; your beauty exceeds all that I say.","My soul runs after you like a raging camel; my body is a collar bound upon the neck of that camel.","Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz, my heart is pregnant by you; when shall I see a child born under your auspices?","The dissolutes are all assembled in the Magian monastery; give one bumper to that unique elder.","The blood-shedding master, love, has seized door and roof, and reason is fugitive from house to house.","That most mighty beauty flung aside one veil, and all the people of the time departed out of the veil.","The same is with the lovers who fell into this sea; what place is there for safety and security?","How shall love grow cold from the voice of reproach?","A lion never runs from a woman’s scream.","Fill the bumper with the divine wine, leave not the gods of nature standing in the midst.","First give that bumper to the talkative soul, so that its speaking faculty may not utter any more legends.","Once speech is blocked, a forrent will come so that you will see not one sign left of beings and places.","What a fire Shams al-Haqq-i Tabriz has kindled!","Brave, fire, congratulations, O flames!","This midnight who has come like moonshine?","It is the messenger oflove, coming from the prayer-niche.","Bringing a forch, he has set fire to sleep; he has come from the presence of the unsleepy king.","Who is this who has started all this tumult in the city, who came upon the harvest of the darvish like a flood?","Who is this?","Say, for in all the world there is none but he, a king came to the door of the house of a doorkeeper.","Who is this who has spread such a table of bounty, who has come laughing, to lead the companions to the table?","A cup is in his hand which makes an end of the dervish; from that grape’s juice the color stains his lips.","Hearts are trembling, all souls impatient — one fraction of that trembling has fallen upon quicksilver.","That gentleness and grace with which he treats his servant is the same gentleness and grace which make the ermine.","Of that lament and those tears which are the dry and wet of love, one gentle melody has reached the waterwheel.","A bunch of keys is under love’s armpit, come to open all the gates.","Bird of the heart, if the hunter has broken your wings, yet the bird escapes from the snare when it is beaten and broken [dead].","Silence!","Embodied similitudes are not mannerly, or manners have never entered your ear.","As it is late and raining, to home, to home!","Welcome, all friends, to home, to home!","How long like owls banished about the ruins?","To home, to home!","Bright-hearted companions, haste, despite all the blind ones, to home, to home!","You reasonable, sober, full of sorrow, do not disturb our hearts!","To home, to home!","How long this loveplay with devil’s forms, calling them houris?","To home, to home!","You have seen the grain and not seen the harvest; even so are ants, to home, to home!","Make not how and why; friend, leave grazing to cattle, to home, to home!","In that house is the concert of the circumcision feast, with the ritually pure, to home, to home!","Shams al-Din-i Tabriz has built a home for the naked; to home, to home.","Your heart has become like granite rock, and what can be done with granite rock?","What can glass do with granite rock, except become shattered to pieces.","You laugh like the true dawn that the star may yield its life before you.","Since love opened its bosom, thought has fled into boundary; When patience perceived that flight, it too escaped on horse.","Patience and reason are gone; passion remained, weeping and in a fever.","Some men, being separated from your wine, are fallen on the road like dregs; Though their livers have turned to blood, yet they are nimble and reckless on this path.","Because of this business we have become strangers to reason and to the busybody heart.","Love is the reality of command; poetry is the drum of indication.","Beware, for our prince is galloping, every morning he is on a raid.","Leave this theme of loneliness and separation, out of terror of which descriptive language breaks.","The imam has fled; muezzin, be silent, descend from the minaret.","What is this hurricane blowing along from heaven?","Hundreds of thousands of ships staggering and reeling before it.","The ship escapes through the wind and is sunk by the wind; by the wind it is given life and is done to death.","The wind in God’s command is like the breath in yours — by your command brought to cursing or reciting praises.","Know that the winds are various as fanned by the fan of predestination; by the zephyr the world is prosperous, by the pestilence it is reduced to a waste.","Lord, you have shown the wind, do not hide the fan; to see the fan is the lamp of the breast of the pure ones.","Whoever sees it as a secondary cause is surely a formworshiper; whoever sees it as cause has become the realityknowing light.","The people of form give their lives for the desire of a bead; to the eyes of people of the sea of reality, pearls have become cheap.","The imitator, becoming the dust of true men, transmits reports from them; the others keep silence, concealed behind them.","The seeker kept his eye to the path and picked up chippings; see that chipping-piclcer of the road has now entered the mine.","We tremble over our faith as a mother over her child; of what should that clever one tremble who has become entirely faith?","Like a moon you are waning in the desire for leadership; let me see you like a sun, become a king without retinue.","How long will you say that smoke is a proof of fire?","Silence!","let me see you become without smoke both fire and proof.","Say how long heaven has turned and goes on turning over your head; let me see you like Messiah gone above heaven!","You who seek a portion from me — Bring this and that!","— let me see you escape from this and that, and become that and that.","Enough brawling drunkard, chattering talker, let me see you become silent-speaking like the pan of the balance.","Ha, to and enter the sea; do not look on from afar, for the pearl is in the depths of the sea, the foam on the shore","When you have seen the face of the king, go forth from the house like a pawn; when you have seen the face of the sun, become lost like a star.","When by that slave-cherishing you have become pure and a man of prayer, invite all like the muezzin from the minaret.","Gaze on this moon through which your heart has become bright, look upon this king who has arrived on horseback.","I will not fear and tremble when he draws the dagger of omnipotence; by God I will give his dagger a bribe and a portion.","What water is there that matches his grace?","For he produces two hundred fountains from the breast of marble and rock.","All day you dance for vermicelli and porridge; what do you know of the desire of the heart for this verse and song?","Since I saw his silvery breast I flee from silver and gold, for his breeze flees away from the hand that counts silver.","You have no fruit because you are light-laden like the willow; you have nothing of that business because you have become a jack-of- all-trades.","All the pilgrims have gone to the sanctuary and seen the Kaaba; you have not even bought a camel with a broken bridle.","Look at your companions, all drunk and dissolute; be silent, and become likewise, you brawler.","Give that spirited wine, for we are all in such a state that we cannot tell wine from cup, head from foot.","We are all fresher than the lily and the rose branch, become entirely spirit and spiritual glow.","All men are in the bond of passion, and passion is our slave, for we have all escaped from this cycle of time.","Like the reed pipe we make voice at the sugar lip of the beloved; we sell the shop for we are all mine.","The light of the sun devours our bodies like a shadow, for in form we are like being and space.","Our faces are saffron -pale out of fear for the evil eye; we are companions of the garden and tulipbed.","We bring the Koran and swear an oath to the saki: But from your hand and palm we will not take wine.","Whoever has a soul catches the scent of the rose garden of the soul; whoever has that realizes we are all that.","Our hearts are free of care like the heart of a bird, for we are all lighthearted for that heavy cup.","Kings yield up their crowns of gold in love for our path, for we are more belt-bestowing than youthful fortune.","Seek our souls in the front line of battle, for we go forward like arrow and lance.","We do not sit behind the veil of the shadows of mankind, for like the light of dawn we all tear veils apart.","We were evening, through the sun of the world we have become morning; we were wolves, now we are famous shepherds.","Since Shams-i Tabriz displayed his soul-adorning cheek, we are running like the spirit towards him with heart and soul.","O soul, who is that standing in the house of the heart?","Who may be on the royal throne but the king and the prince?","He signaled with his hand, Tell me, what do you want of me?","What does a drunken man desire but sweetmeats and a cup of wine?","Sweetmeats hanging from the heart, a cup of pure light, an eternal banquet laid in the privacy of He is the Truth.","How many deceivers there are at the wine-drinkers’ feast!","beware, lest you fall, soft and simple man!","In the circle of reprobates beware lest you be eye-shut like the

garden the Beloved like a rose is riding; all the rest are on foot.","He is both sword and swordsman, both slain and slayer, all reason, and giving reason to the mind.","That king is Salah al-DIn — may he endure forever, may his bountiful hand be perpetually a necklace on my neck!","I saw my sweetheart wandering about the house; he had taken a rebec and was playing a melody.","With a plectrum like fire he was playing a sweet melody, drunken and dissolute and charming from the Magian wine.","He was invoking the saki in the air of Iraq; the wine was his object, the saki was his excuse.","The moonfaced saki, pitcher in his hand, entered from a corner and set it in the middle.","He filled the first cup with that flaming wine; did you ever see water sending out flames?","He set it on his hand for the sake of the lovers, then prostrated and kissed the threshold.","My sweetheart seized it from him and quaffed the wine; flames from that wine went running over his face.","He was beholding his own beauty, and saying to the evil eye, Never has there been, nor shall there come in this age, another like me.","I am sprung from you and likewise you have devoured me, I melt in you since through you I froze.","Now you press me in your hand, now under your foot with grief; for the grape does not become wine until it is pressed.","Like the light of the sun, you have cast us on the earth, then little by little carried us back in that direction.","We return from the body’s window like light into the orb of a sun, pure of sin and blemish.","Whoever sees that orb says, He has become alive, and whoever comes to the window says, So-and-so is dead.","He has veiled our origin in that cup of pain and joy; in the core of origin we are pure, all the rest left behind like dregs.","Source of the source of souls, Shams-i Haqq-i Tabriz, a hundred livers are on fire for you — so how many kidneys?","The sun has risen from the depths of the water, hear La ilaha ilia ’ llah from every mote.","Why speak of motes?","When the sun of the soul arrived, they robbed from the sun its very cloak and cap.","The moon of the heart like Adam has emerged from water and clay, and a

satisfied with that rotted grain because it was not aware of our verdant ear of corn.","Say to the ant, It is springtime, and you have hands and feet; why do you not make your way from the tomb to the open land?","Why speak of ants?","Solomon has rent the robe of yearning; punish me not, O God, for this useless image.","But they cut a gown to fit the purchaser’s figure; though the garment is long,

separated as grain from chaff.","Since I am intoxicated with your face, learned sage, gaze on me with those intoxicated eyes.","Through your intoxicated eyes my heart writhes (for it is mad); drunkard and madman have a liking for each other’s ways.","See my wasted heart and look fondly on me, for the sun gazes fondly upon ruins.","Go gaze, so that, by that one gaze which you gaze, marvelous trees

on your stone, that you might escape from stoniness and set loot on gemhood.","The sun of eternal love has shone in your heart; first, that your servanthood might increase, and lastly, that you might show mastery.","The sun says to the unripe grape, I have come to your kitchen so that you may not sell vinegar anymore but make a trade of sweetmaking.","The king says to the falcon, I bound up your eyes so that you may break with your own kind and only regard my face.","The falcon says, Yes, I am obedient; only on your beauty i gaze, only by your image I pass, and serve you with my soul.","The

makes him into a jewel; if a jewel, he makes him better still, better than the moon and Jupiter.","You are not a Jupiter without worth, but the light of God has purchased: if you have anything of Joseph, you take the scent of this shirt.","To me, as to Mary, dates come forth from a withered branch without cause; to me, like Jesus, mastership comes unasked in the cradle.","See the grapes without garden and vine, the light without day and night; this glorious fortune, given by God without the process of judgment.","Through my firelike face the world’s bath became hot; like children weep less for a picture painted on the bathhouse wall.","Tomorrow you will see its face become food for snake and mouse, those narcissus eyes a gateway of ants.","You are the moonshine driven to the moon, the wall left dark; to Him we return has come true — Look yonder, if you can see.","Or go to Tabriz, enjoy Shams al-Din, or believe the words of the truthful describers.","Beware, Joseph of the

your homeland with learning and accomplishment.","I said, O soul of mine, what information shall I gain without you?","Who goes from you for the sake of information?","Only the uninformed.","When I quaff wine from your hand, I am unaware and drunk and happy, without danger and fear of anyone, untroubled by any man.","He spoke words in my ear like the words of highwaymen; the king rolled me off my head, he bewitched me.","The story is long indeed — alas for the cunning and deceit, if this night his generosity does not show us any dawn.","You have come in order to expound my secret to all, to reveal and indicate that signless king.","Last night your drunken fantasy came cup in hand.","I said, I will not drink wine; it said, Do not, the more loss to you.","I said, I fear if I drink, shame will fly from my head; I will reach out to your curls, and you will withdraw from me.","It saw that I was making airs and said, Come, it is astonishing that when someone offers you his soul, you should frown on him.","With all you are deceit and cheating; with the like of me would you be the cheat too?","I am the provost of secrets; do you hide a secret from me?","I am the treasure of the heart of earth; why do you lay your head on the earth?","I am the qibla of heaven; why do you turn your face to heaven?","Look at the king who gives you the {light} of vision; if you angrily turn your head away, you will do the same on the day of death.","Be pale of cheek for him who gave you the color of your cheeks; why do you saffron your face for the sake of a shadow?","Be like a cock, time-aware and leader; it would be a pity to make your cock into a hen.","io Sit crookedly but tell the truth; truth has its reward.","I am your soul and spirit — do you depart to another?","If like

generosity better than this, that with your sins and guilt I should expound how you should lament before me?","Enough for those words which will be written are not contained in the mouth; if you were to open every atom, you could make a mouth.","The sand has become satiated with the water; I have not become, bravo!","No string in this world is there to fit my long bow.","The sea is my least draft, the mountain my least morsel; what a leviathan I am.","O God!","Open for me a way.","I am more thirsty than death, I writhe like hell; is not any good fat morsel coming to me, I wonder?","The lean one oflove has no remedy but union; none is there but your hand to feed grass to the mouth oflove.","Reason enters your trap and loses both head and beard, though it be heavy-headed or swift to leap.","You are the implanter of sincerity in the heart of every Unitarian; you likewise print images in the heart of every anthropomorphist.","Noah from the zenith of your wave becomes mate of a raft; spirit from the scent of your street is drunk and dissolute and distraught.","Be silent, and return to the palace of the silent ones; you, cast in a village, return to the city of love.","Restless heart of mine, say, of what substance are you?","Of fire?","Of water?","Of man?","Of peri?","From what direction have you come?","On what food pastured?","What have you seen in nonexistence?","Why are you flying thither?","Why do you uproot me?","Why aim at my destruction?","Why cut the road of wisdom?","Why tear your own veil?","All animals and living beings are wary of nothingness except you, who are carrying your baggage into nonentity.","You are going hot and hurrying, drunk, dissolute, to whose counsel would you hearken?","How long will you fall for the coquetry of men?","You are a forrent flowing, flowing from the mountaintop of this world towards the sea of no-place, faster than my breath.","Garden and spring are bewildered to know by what breeze you blow; lily and cypress are intoxicated with you: what a rose, what a narcissus you are!","The music of the tambourine whose hoop is not accompanied by tinkling cymbals, like the ravings of an unbeliever, enters not our ears.","The Moses of your love said to me Become untouchable; how do I not flee from all?","How not run away from the Samaritan?","I have fled from all, though I am in the midst of men, as the Ja‘fari gold coin is in the midst of the earth of the mine.","Though the gold cries out two thousand times, I am gold, till it leaves the mine, no one will purchase it.","Do not heap snow on yourself, lest you congeal; your snow will make you congeal even though you be the furnace of fire.","He who does not ferment of himself destroys your ferment; and he who kindles no fire, brotherhood

ardently; do not make your head so-and-so, do not listen slackly and superficially.","I would have shown my face to you if I were not wholly soul; the sign of me would have been seen were I not without sign.","Silver of bosom, am I not gold?","Ruby of lips, am I not jewel?","I would have shown my gold-essence were I not in the mine.","Your grace does not let me, else I would drive away all the people of the world in desire of you, O sugar, like a fly.","The rosebush of the soul said to your love, Did I not fear, I would be all tongue like the lily.","Men say, You are a reasonable man, for a moment come to yourself.","I reply, If I were like this, for a moment I would be like that.","If the silver-robed moon were worthy of your street, I would take him by the waist and draw him along to you.","If the wave of passion for your love let me be for a moment, I would extinguish all fires and be the salvation oflovers.","If he had not sewed up my eye of time with the arrow of jealousy, I would be openly and visibly like a bow in his hand.","This is a symbol and metonymy for Tabriz and Shams-i Din; ah, how would it be if I had been an interpreter before him.","Passion for that Beloved brought me out of learning and reciting so that I became mad and distracted.","Once I took my way earnestly to prayer rug and mosque; I put on the shirt of abstinence to increase good works.","Love entered the mosque and said, Right- guided master, rend the bond of being; why are you in bondage to prayer?","Let not your heart tremble before the blow of my sword; lay down your neck, if you wish to journey from knowledge to vision.","Do full justice to ruffianism, if you are a dissolute and drunkard; if you are lovely and beautiful, why do you remain behind the veil?","Lovely ones may not flee from exhibiting their features; how can idols suffer not to indulge in coquetry and face decoration?","Now through your face you have bestowed love and impatience on reason, now through your eyes played the Messiah to the sick; Now with your tresses given the image of God’s cord to the believer, now through twisted curls given a cross to the christian.","If you have beheld your beauty which excels the sun, why have you withered and decayed in this dusty prison?","Why do you not become refreshed by the graces of the heart’s springtime?","Why do you not laugh like the rose and pound ambergris?","Why do you not ferment like wine in the vat of this world, that the fermenting may bring you forth from this enameled lid?","Why is your Jacob denied the lighting of your lovely face?","Joseph of the lovely ones, why do you languish in the bottom of the well?","Behold your own beauty, ignorant one, in the light of the souls of the Pegs \autdds\, for the believer is the mirror of the believer in time of loneliness.","The earth sees its secrets in the face of the garden, ‘What through its beauty and charm I have in my heart.’ The rock sees its secret in the ruby and turquoise, ‘I have a treasure in my heart yearning to emerge.’ The dark iron sees its heart in the mirror, ‘I am recipient to light, after all things bright.’ When nonentities see how nonentities have been changed, they come into existence to enjoy a meeting.","Would the fly have gone around to every dunghill had it known that by effort and virtue the ‘Anqa comes out of its composition?","When the Sufi has become ‘son of the moment,’ he does not become an idle person tomorrow; that person soon becomes idle who is a fool and a procrastinator.","Sit among sweethearts if you are not immature and impotent; use yourself to lovers, my friend, do not wander about everywhere.","Fish, it has become certain to you from the sea behind your back; turn your face round and go back, since you are a sea creature.","Hear the call of Return, go to the water of life; enter the water and go gaily, why do you linger in water and clay?","With heart and soul you have gone to a place where neither soul nor heart remain; on your own foot you have gone to a place where you bite your own hand.","Become gold through the sun of eternity; go not to another’s gold, for love of gold makes you yellow, though your face is silvery.","The world says to you, ‘Why have you become my slave?","After all you are born of the king, it is I who should be your slave.’ The sea says to you, ‘I shall be your steed, rather than that you should be my steed, acting as porter and water-carrier.’ Be silent, I was like you too, but I kept silence and found rest; if you listen to me, you will be silent too, and find rest.","Today the king in secret visited the madmen; a shout went up from the souls of the spiritual distracted ones.","Amid the cries that king recognized my voice, for my voice had become purified of animal breaths.","He signaled so royally that the madman leaped from his bonds; if I am mad, O king, you are the Solomon of the divs.","O king, you share the secrets of the birds and the spells of the divs; now if it is fitting you should recite a spell on this madman.","An elder approached the king saying, Bind him in chains, for this madman is causing enough disturbance and disorder in the divan","My king said, This madman will accept no chain other than the chain of my tress; you do not know his character.","He bursts thousands of bonds to fly to my hand; to us returning he becomes, for he is a royal falcon.","There entered the city of man a mighty forrent; the heavens were destroyed, and a waterwheel of pure light was set turning.","That city was simply madness, mankind therein distracted; for he had escaped from yesterday and tomorrow, when he awakened from a sleep.","The water boiled and became a wind which caused every mountain to fly like straw before a fierce wind, hot and burning.","Having cleaved through the mountains, he revealed the mines, you could see ruby on ruby shining like moonlight.","In that glow you behold him, a Chinese moonface, his two hands of separation full of blood like the hands of a butcher.","From the scent of the blood of his hands all the spirits are drunk with him; all the skies abject before him — bravo, the gracious Giver!","When he slays, it is like the trampling of grapes that through the perishing may become immortal, the grapes become syrup.","Though you trample hundreds of thousands of grapes, all will be one when such a door has been opened for the soul towards unification.","It is necessary that Shams-i Tabriz!","should take the hand of that soul, put the ring on his finger, bestow kingly apparatus.","Fire -worshiping heart of mine who spins like a ball in the fire, say to the saki, Quick now, a glass of lees to begin with!","Come, lip-biting saki, cook with that wine the raw ones; bravo, garden and orchard and vine from which you pressed the grapes!","I will give a hint which no one gives; the hint is this, O fair of stature, that on that night you transported me unselfed, you committed me over to that moonface of mine.","You, reason, do you remember how, when the king of reason out of love bestowed that fiery wine on me, at the first breath you died?","That darling brought two dishes, one of fire, one full of gold; if you take gold, it becomes fire, and if you set on fire, you win the game.","See the proud saki!","Extinguish that pretty fire!","What do you know of the power of the fire, for there you are a little child?","Get out of the fire, you will rise happy out of Shams al-Din-i tabriz!; and if you flee into the gold, like gold you will have congealed.","My heart came like a pen in the fingers of the Beloved; tonight it is writing zai, tomorrow it will write mi.","He trims a pen for epistolary style, copying and the rest; the pen says, I am resigned, you know; who am I, lord?","Now he blackens its face, now he rubs it in his hair; now he holds it upside down, now he uses it for a task.","On one sheet he cancels a world and makes it headless; on another sheet he delivers a [perilous] conjunction from calamity.","The splendor of the pen is according to the dignity of the scribe, whether it is in the hand of a king or a commander.","He splits its head for the reason he knows; Galen knows best what is best for the patient.","That pen is unable to utter by its own reason any applause; that pen knows not of its own nature to make disapproval.","Whether I call it pen or call it flag, in it is sense and senselessness — bravo, the conscious senseless one!","The mind can not compass its description, for in it is the union of opposites, a composition without composition, amazing!","— constrained yet with free will.","By the right of old companionship and friendship, do not repeat to the Beloved all that I uttered last night, unconscious and sick; But if, as God decrees, that moon hears of these things, he himself knows what a melancholy lover will say in the darkness of night.","When reason is not at home, the tale will be distorted — now low, now high, now war, now submissiveness.","If God should scatter my frenzy over the world, you will not see one man with reason; all will be stripped of their reason.","Reason, can it be that you pour these dark suggestions into me?","Cloud, can it be you who rains upon me this troubled potion?","Moslems, Moslems, guard well your hearts; let none go about me, either to sightsee or to sympathize.","At dawn I said to that moon, O I body and you soul, I am in this state that you see, and weep for what you know.","You are beyond infidelity and faith, and drive a fast mount; what a fearless king you are!","Do precisely as you are.","Just once return and pass our way, gaze on the thicket of the souls — behold the trees wet with blood, like branches of coral.","You have heard how a raw one gets a reputation among men, not fearing that self-will may stamp its brand on his forehead.","Do not disapprove of the pure ones; be afraid of the blow of the fearless ones — for the patience of the soul of the suffering ones will annihilate you utterly.","You who are selfed, do not wrestle with the unselfed; you enemy of the darvishes, do not mix in fight with them with a stratagem of which you are incapable; For Shams al-DTn-i Tabriz!, with life -bestowing and bloodspilling, kindles the fire to a fierceness by Divine powers.","O spiritual form, why are you fleeing from us?","You are after all of the house, you know the state of this servant.","By the right of my hot tears, by the right of my pale cheeks, by the bond that I have with you beyond this human phase — Though the whole world were laughing, without you it were a prison; enough this, show compassion to this deprived prisoner.","Though I am with all my very dear ones, when you are afar I am sore distraught — O God, may such distraction not be the lot of anyone.","What shall I tie to that fleeing foot of yours so that you may not flee?","You resemble an unfaithful soul; you are fleeing like our Beloved.","Though you gallop up out of the nine spheres and set fire to the seven seas, I will rend to pieces spheres and seas with love and patience and strength.","Even if like the sun you surmount the fourth heaven, I will still come secretly to your stirrup like a shadow.","The physician of the soul brought a tray as a present; if you are a doting old man you will become fair and youthful.","It gives life to the body, intoxication to the soul; it takes away from the heart’s slackness, from the cheeks’ pallor.","That was the tray of Jesus, it became the inheritance of the physicians; you will find in it the antidote, if you have swallowed the poison of death.","You who seek that tray, turn your face to this qibla; when you turn your face thither, you will become the moonfaced of the world.","There is a pill hidden there which touches not the teeth, neither wet nor dry, neither hot nor cold.","Through that pill smaller than a grain you will come to the top of that dome, for that has become the dwelling place of Jesus; and that grain, for all its smallness, Has become a protection, and every powerless man seeks the protection of your generosity; never will he whom you have nourished become lean.","I said to the physician of the soul, Today in thousands of ways there is a sure footing, since you have trodden firmly.","He to whom you have given a place will never be by aught displaced; grief will not pare that heart which you have pared of grief.","Be silent and hush your words now that the test has befallen you; say farewell to pledges, you are free of those pledges.","My soul, why do you tarry so long in the land of exile?","Return from this exile; how long will you be dispersed?","I sent a hundred letters, I signaled a hundred ways; either you do not know the way or you do not read the letter.","If you do not read the letter, the letter itself reads you; and if you do not know the way, you are in the grip of Him who knows the way.","Return, for in this prison no one knows your worth; sit not with the stonyhearted, for you are a gem of this mine.","You who have escaped from heart and soul, washed your hands of heart and soul, leaped forth from the snares of the world — return, for you are one of the falcons.","You are both water and stream and are seeking for water; you are both lion and deer and are better than they.","How far is it from you to the Soul?","Are you more remarkable than the Soul?","Are you commingled with the Soul, or a ray of the Beloved?","You are the light of the moon in the night, candy and sugar on the lip; dear lord, what a person you are!","Dear lord, you are a divine marvel!","Every moment you bestow beauty and splendor, and we bestow heart and head and soul.","Such a market is very fine — you give and take splendidly.","It is of

move without desire?","All the parts of the world are lovers, and every part of the universe is drunk with encounter; Only they do not tell you their secrets — it is not proper to tell the secret save to one worthy.","The grazers, whose pasture grazes on the cup and table of the sweet lord.","Did not the ants tell their secret to Solomon, did not the mountain echo back to David?","Were this heaven not a lover, his breast would not be serene; And if the sun had not been a lover, there would be no radi ance in his beauty.","If earth and mountain were not lovers, no blade of grass would spring from their breasts; If the sea were not aware oflove, it would finally come to rest somewhere","Be a lover, that you may know the lover; be faithful, that you may see the Faithful.","Heaven did not

moment there shines in the mirror an amazing figure of beauty.","Every form is as the Sultan’s falcon; itself a quarry, it seeks a quarry.","Do you not seek a sign of the separated ones?","Where has gone that fidelity and affection?","The fishes are on this dry land of exile: come, water of the sea of life!","How long shall the fish remain out of its water?","What am I to say?","I do not know;

soul.","You say to me, Be silent — have you not repented that you are leaving the road of tonguelessness?","By the dust of your feet, I was not with myself out of drunkenness and wine and dizziness.","I am no better in silence than a vat; the wine does not remain hidden in the vat.","The wine of love is a more bubbling wine, for ordinary wine bubbles for a moment and this is ever-bubbling.","His lace, red as the Judas blossom, does that which only a hundred jars of Judas-red wine can do.","I could describe his lips further but your mouth would burn if you were to recite

sweetsmelling for you are rose-water.","You are the zephyr, for you make the garden to laugh, though to the thirsty you are forture.","Come, see the numerous drunkards in the bazaar, if you are a bailiff and making a census.","Like beggars for bread now questioning, like sufferers now responding.","io Your smile is brief as a lightning flash, so you are a prisoner in the shadows of the clouds.","Enter the assembly of the Eternal king; behold circulating the porringers like water troughs.","You are a lovely ruby, but you are in the mine; you are very beautiful, but you are in the veil.","If to the king you fly, you are the white falcon; if to the graveyard you fly, you are the raven.","Youthful of fortune, clap hands and say, Youth, O youth, O youth!","Say no word to anyone,

sweetly.","Said, joyous and happy, bring the wine forward immediately That we may drink happily and sleep sweetly in the shadow of eternal grace — Drink not by way of throat and stomach, sleep not as

assembly is like a lamp, and you are like water; the lamp is ruined by water.","The sun has shone upon the gathering; depart from the midst, for you are as a cloud.","Sit not at the table, for you are raw; where is the smell of kabob, if you are lcabob?","You went ahead, saying, I am the chamberlain; by Allah, you are not the chamberlain, you are the curtain.","Since chamberlains of doors have

seek after the reward.","Sit and rise with the wakeful ones, for this caravan has departed and you are asleep.","Through Shams al-DIn you will arrive at the stage, and in tabriz you will find the way.","Union with you is the source of happiness, for those are but forms and this is reality.","Break not for a moment from your servant, for a ship cannot sail without water.","I am a faulty Koran

me, who have cast myself into affliction for the sweetnesses I have experienced in the nonentity of selflessness.","What a life, what a hundred lives indeed, if a man should sacrifice them in desire for selflessness and for the sake of selflessness.","Lover, sit not with sorrowful ones, lest dust should fall on the joy of selflessness.","Use cruelly anyone who is a lover of prudence that you may find new pleasures in the faithfulness of selflessness.","When you know selflessness, leadership loses its market for you; head and leadership are as the dust of the foot of selflessness.","It is

Have you seen, Moslems, a runaway slave?","A slave moonfaced, music-scented, a troublemaker — swift of pace in time of coquetry, in time of peace slow.","A boy, ruby-robed, charming of countenance, sugar-sweet, cypress-stature, saucy-eyed, acute, perfectly poised; In his bosom a rebec, in his hand a pluclcer; he plays a sweet air, charming, well-seated.","Does anyone have a fruit of the garden of his beauty?","Or a bunch of roses to smell from the rose bed of his loveliness?","A Joseph by whose price the king of Egypt was bankrupted, on every side heart-wounded ones like Jacob by his glance.","I will give freely my sweet life as lawful to whomever brings me a sign of him, or even a veiled hint.","Ah, from those lightning-casting, sweet, mischievous cheeks!","A thunderbolt from its lightning has fallen on the soul of every helpless one"," When before the row of pearls and rubies shone like fire, a sea of pearls surged out of the rock.","This heart forn into a hundred pieces gave

shop with your love; it found a fine colleague and fellow- worker in that shop.","Through the sun of your love, the motes of the souls have become like the moon, and every moment a star of felicity comes into the sky.","Your form is invisible, yet relates every detail — like the messiah through the light of Mary, the spirit of God in the cradle.","Shams-i TabrizI, what inconsistency is there in the heart’s states, at once abiding in love and fugitive from love?","soul of a hundred rose gardens, you have vanished from jasmine; soul of the soul of my soul, why have you vanished from me?","Since heaven through you is resplendent, what is veiled to you?","Since the body through you is living, how have you vanished from the body?","Out of the perfection of God’s jealousy and the

rope?","What a joyous pleasure it will be, what a charming spectacle, when such a part returns to the source of the source!","Wine will come from every side to its hand, without a cup, from every side to its eye, a darling, enchanting fair — A darling who, did the granite rock catch scent of her ruby, the granite rock would receive life to become conscious.","The wine stole one attribute from the lips of my darling; inevitably the soul became a wine -bibber for the love of those lips.","In dawn a monk went along with me on the way to the monastery; I saw him a fellow-sufferer and fellow-worker

drunkard?","Happy the moment when that said of the assembly issues an invitation, when the cup of wine rides on the hand of the said.","The particles of our bodies will be happy through that immortal wine; this greedy body will escape from the grief of eating at tables.","Happy the moment when the Beloved demands contributions from the drunkards, takes pledge from us with sweet and lovely cheeks.","Happy the moment when in drunkenness the tip of your tress is confused, the helpless heart passionately takes to curlcounting.","Happy the moment when the heart says to you, I have no plantation, and you say, Whatever you plant shall grow for you.","Happy the moment when the night of separation says, Goodnight; happy the moment when that springtide light shall give greeting.","Happy the moment when the cloud of divine grace comes in the air, from that cloud you rain pearls of grace on the desert.","This earth, which is thirstier than that black sand, shall swallow the water of life completely and make no dust.","Love has entered upon us with cups and wine; drunkenness has appeared to us from a hidden beloved.","A discourse surged like waves scattering pearls, it is necessary to silence it, since you do not let it pass into here.","When I reached your city you withdrew into a corner from me; when I left your city you did not give me a good-bye glance.","Whether you choose kindness or incline to rancor, you are all the soul’s ease, you are all the feast’s decoration.","The cause of your jealousy is that you are hidden, otherwise you are evident as the sun, for you are manifest through every mote.","If you choose to be in a corner, you are darling of the heart and a prince; and if you rend the veil, you have rent the veils of all.","The heart of unbelief by you is confounded, the heart of faith by your wine is happy; you have robbed all of their sense, you have pulled the ears of all.","All roses are a prey to December, all heads in pawn to wine; you have redeemed both these and those from the hand of death.","Since there is no constancy in the rose, since there is no way to the rose, on you only is trust to be put; you are the stay and support.","If a few have cut their hands on account of Joseph’s face, you have deprived two hundred Josephs of the spirit of heart and reason.","You fashion the form of a person from filth and blood, that he may flee two parsangs from the odor of foulness.","You make him a morsel of dust to become pure herbage — he escapes from foulness when you have breathed spirit into him.","Come, heart, go to heaven, go to God’s pasture, since you have grazed awhile in the pasture of cattle","Set all your desire on that of which you have no hope, for out of original hopelessness you have reached thus far.","Be silent, that the lord who bestows words may speak; for he made the door and the lock, and He also made a key.","Tidings are newly arrived — do you perhaps have no news of it?","The envious heart has turned to blood; perhaps you have no heart.","The moon has shown his face, opened the wings of light; borrow a heart and eyes from someone if you do not have any.","Amazing, night and day a flying arrow comes from the hidden bow; yield your life to this arrow.","What can you do?","You have no shield.","Has not the copper of your being been changed, like Moses, to gold by His alchemy?","What care?","Though you have no gold in your bag like Korah?","Within you is an Egypt whose sugarcane bed you are; what care, though you have no supply of sugar from without?","You have become the slave of fc&gt;rm, like the idol-worshipers; you are like Joseph, but within you do not gaze.","By God, when you see your own beauty in the mirror you will be your own idol, you will not pass over to anyone.","O Reason, are you not unjust to call him like the moon?","Why do you call him moon?","Perhaps you have no sight.","Your head is like a lamp containing six wicks; from what are all six alight, if you have not that spark?","Your body is like a camel which travels to the Kaaba of the heart; out of assishness you have not gone on the pilgrimage, not because you have no ass.","If you have not gone to the Kaaba, felicity will draw you on; do not flee, idler, for you have no means of passing from God.","Ho, watchman of the dwelling, what sort of watchman are you?","For the night-thief secretly carries off all our baggage.","Throw cold water on your face, rise up and make a tumult, for because of your sleepiness all our profit has been turned to loss.","Night and the sleep of watchmen are a thief s lamp; why do you not extinguish their lamp with a breath?","Give over being idle; be a night-traveler like the stars.","What do you fear of earthly beings, since you are a celestial rider?","Two or three barks of a dog do not cut off the road to horsemen; what shall a dog or a hay-fed ox snatch from a fierce lion?","What effect have the dog of wrath and the ox of lust on a lion who rends asunder the ranks of vision in the thicket of realities?","Were you not two drops of water, that now you make an ark and a Noah to run to left and right midst the waves of the flood?","Since God is your protection, what peril threatens the road for you?","Your cap reaches the sky, for you are the head of all heads.","What an excellent path it is, with God as companion; the hard journey would become like eternal Paradise.","Do not say, What present shall I bring as a token?","Their own face is enough as a present to the sun and moon.","Whether you go or not, your felicity is running, discharging all the business in tranquillity and love.","When fortune is your slave it does you a thousand services, for it cannot do without you, even though you drive it from the door.","Sleep sweetly, for luck does not sleep on your account; take a stone in your hand, for it will become a ruby of the mine.","Mount heaven like Jesus; say, let me see like Moses, for God will not say to you, Silence, thou shall not see Me.","Silence, O heart; yet what use, if you block the lid of the jar?","the heart of the vat will split when those truths ferment.","Every moment two thousand times you will recite this poem, if you realize how it travels beyond realities.","O idol, you are so subtle that you enter into our soul; O idol, by the right of your grace, pray enter amongst us.","You possess the true world, you have not your home on earth; what would it be if for a time you entered our world?","You are subtle and without mark, you are hidden even from the hidden; this hiddenness of mine shines forth when you enter our hidden part.","Since you possess the speech of all birds, Solomon, what honey you impart to the lip when you enter our tongue!","In the world you alone are king, no one draws your bow; I will fly like an arrow if you enter our bow.","Parade forth, Shams-i Tabriz, for you are the touchstone of god; all our copper turns to gold when you enter our mine.","You have the attribute of God; when you enter any breast, you display from that breast the glow of Mount Sinai.","You have the attribute of a lamp; when you enter a house by night, all the house receives light from the splendor of your brightness.","You have the attribute of wine; when you are in an assembly you kindle two thousand tumults and riots with your sweet graciousness.","When joy is fled, when passion is flown, what grasses and roses grow when you sweetly act the water-carrier!","When the world is frozen, when gaiety is dead, what other worlds you open out of the unseen!","From you comes this importunity in the heart of the restless ones; otherwise what acquaintance would dark earth have with brightness?","You are the sky about the earth revolving night and day; O sky, what do you want of us?","Are you not the source of all light?","Now you scatter rain, now you sift the earth; you are not a seeker of filings, after all, you are all mine and touchstone.","Like men seeking filings night and day you sift the earth; why do you worship earth?","Are you not the qibla of all prayers?","What wonder if a beggar seeks a gift from a king?","This is the wonder — that a king begs from a beggar.","Even more amazing is this — the king has gone so far in petition that the beggar falls into error and thinks he is king.","Sky, are you not king?","Is not the earth your slave?","Then why are you in the air night and day serving the earth?","The sky answers me, No one moves without reason; if a straw flies, that is due to some amber.","My words are meat to the angels; if I speak no words, the hungry angels say, Speak, why are you silent?","You are not of the angels, what do you know of angels’ food?","What should you make of manna?","You deserve chives.","What do you know of this pottage that comes from the kitchen of the brain, where God acts the householder night and day?","Tabriz, say to Shams al-DIn, Turn your face to us.","I err — say, O sun, all face without a back!","My idol scolds, saying, Why have you fallen in the middle of the road?","Idol, why should I not fall from such a wine as you have given me?","Idol, I fell in suchwise that even at the resurrection I shall not rise, when you held such a cup and uncovered such a flask.","I am dissolute, yet I have a little understanding, for you took up my head and placed it in your bosom.","Idol, from your drunken eye which is the wine-holder of love, you give wine without a cup — what a mighty master you are!","It is of your generosity, too, that the wine has swept away my reason, for if it still kept its reason, it should burst with happiness.","You gave me a bowl so that I am clapping my hands, for with one cup I escaped from one thousand undesirable things.","By your two ravishing drunken eyes from which joy was born, you are the primal spirit, for you were not born of any man.","Since it has become certain to my heart that you are the soul of the soul of the soul, open the door of grace, for you are the stay of a hundred worlds.","When separation has become rebellious, you sweetly smite its neck in retribution for your lovers, for you are the sword of the age.","When union has become lean, nourish it with the goblet; everything before you attains nourishment gratis.","Your sun has at last entered Aries in felicity, for the ancient world discovers from you the glow of youth.","What concerts are in the soul, what flagons pouring, which are reaching the ear from that tambourine and harp and songs!","How full is this rose bower with the song of the nightingale, so that from the riotous shouts of the drunkards you cannot tell wine from bowl.","All the branches are in flower, the kings have seized the cup; all have departed out of themselves through the heavenly wine.","Convey my soul’s greetings to those kings, but you will not find anyone sober to convey my greetings to them.","The gnat has quaffed wine and lost its head and beard [feather], and annihilated Nimrod with a dagger, io If the wine does this to a gnat, say, what will it do to an elephant?","What shall I do?","The wine of placeless land cannot be described.","From his life-granting wine the dog of the cave is his lionseizer which does nothing but act the shepherd around the cavern of the drunkards.","If a dog has become so beside itself, consider what the raging lion, when it is faithful, discovers from the wine of those vessels.","Tabriz has become an East through the rising of Shams alDln, for sparks reach the stars of spiritual truths from him.","Go, love, for you have become the most perfect of the lovely ones; you have smitten the necks of penitence and the penitent.","What can one rely upon with your love?","— for you are such a thunderbolt.","Who can associate with you?","— for you are all brawling.","Neither earth nor heaven can stand or withstand you; you are not in these six directions, so whence have you come?","The eight paradises are in love with you; how beautiful is your face!","The seven hells tremble at you; what a fire temple you are!","Hell says to you, Pass, for I cannot endure you.","You are the Paradise of Paradise and were the Hell of Hell.","Lovers’ eyes are wet on their skirts because of your sweet eyes; you are the provocation and brigand of every ascetic man and woman.","To be without you in the cloister is nothing but madness, for you are the very life of the cloister and temple.","Give justice to my ruined heart, O judge of love!","— for you have taken tribute from my ruined village.","Simple heart of mine, from whom do you seek justice?","It is lawful to love to shed blood, if you are of this guild, io Justice for lovers is beyond the bounds of the soul; you are engaged in useless thought and fancy.","Only the angels’ attributes are privy to love for sure; you are a prisoner of the attributes of donkey and div and wild beast.","Enough, practice not magic; first deliver yourself, for you are the prisoner of the passion for magic and jugglery.","Gaze on the cheeks of love that you may gain the attributes of true men; sit not with the cold ones so you will not be chilled by their breath.","From the cheeks of love seek something other than the form; your business is to be a fellow sufferer with love.","If you have the attributes of a clod, you will never fly in the air; you will fly in the air if you break to pieces and become dust.","If you do not break to pieces, he who composed you will break you; when death breaks you, how will you become a unique pearl?","When a leaf becomes yellow, the fresh root makes it green; why are you content with a love from which you turn yellow?","Go, nimble-rising soul go on a strange journey to the sea of meanings, for you are a precious pearl.","If you remember, you have passed through water and clay; do not be vexed that you are passing from this terrace too.","Wash your wings of this water and clay, and become light and nimble; what are you doing not to fly in the wake of your friends who have flown?","Ho, break the pitcher and enter the river, O water of life; before every pitcher- breaker how long will you be the potter?","From this mountaintop go like a forrent towards the sea, for this mountain to no one’s body offers an abiding-place.","Enough, cut not away from the Sun either to East or West, for through him you are now a crescent, now as a moon at the full.","By the right and sanctity of that, that you are the soul of all men, fill a cup with that whose description you know well.","Turn everything upside down, leave neither up nor down, so that men may know that today you are in this maidan {arena, square}.","Strike the fire of wine in the chattel of shyness and shame; the drunkards’ hearts are weary of secret joy.","The time has come for you to bring back to us that departed heart, that you should set aflying our reasons like young doves.","You are speaking subtleties in the ring of dissolute drunkards; it is fine when the treasure shines out in a ruin.","Circumambulate the fermented wine among these consumed ones; place before the raw ones that fricassee and eggplant concoction.","What has become of me?","You tell me, for how should I know what has become of me, your lips utter [those] words so easily.","With such a gait, when will you reach the station?","With such a habit, how will you gain the goal?","You are very heavy of soul and camel-hearted; how will you arrive among the nimble-spirited?","With such grossness how will you be modest?","With such a joining [attachment for the world], how will you reach the joiner?","Since there is no opening (readiness) in your head, how will you achieve the solving of the difficult secret?","You are like water left in this clay; so how will you attain the pure from water and clay?","Disregard the sun and moon like Abraham, else how will you attain the perfect sun?","Since you are weak, go, flee to the grace of God, for without the Gracious how will you attain the excellence?","Without the tender care of that sea of loving kindness, how will you reach the shore of such a wave?","Without the Buraq oflove and the labor of Gabriel how will you like Muhammad attain all the stages?","You take shelter in those who are without shelter; how will you attain the shelter of the welcoming king?","Before bismillah sacrifice yourself utterly; else, when you lie dead, how will you attain the Name of God?","Once more you have resolved to go, once more you have made your heart like iron.","No, do not extinguish the lamp of our friendship; you have poured oil into our lamp.","By Allah, you have filled this world with rose and eglantine and lily of your own face.","By Allah, let no enemy say you are a friend who did the enemy’s work.","By Allah, keep your servants together, you who have brightened the world.","Once more you are laying on one side the love -plays you did with me.","By Allah, you have purified the skirt of the evil spirit by the scatter of your sleeves.","Mine of goldminters, Salah al-DIn, like the moon you have made a harvest of silver.","O, you who have shaken a whole world, the voice of the reed, the voice of the reed, the voice of the reed.","What is the reed?","To that beloved of the sweet kiss the place to kiss, the place to kiss, the place to kiss.","That reed without hand and foot fetches from men hand and foot, hand and foot, hand and foot.","The reed is a pretext; this is not the responsibility of the reed, this is nothing but the sound of the wing of that phoenix.","God Himself it is; what is all this veil?","It is drawing the people of God to God.","We are beggars, God is the All-Sufficient ; know, what you see of the beggar is due to the rich.","We are all darkness and God the light: from the sun came the rays of this abode.","Since the light in the house is mingled with shadow, if you desire the light, come out of the house to the roof.","Now you are happy, now depressed; if you do not want a depressed heart, depart out of this depression.","You are putting me on trial; O love, you know my weakness, yet you go on doing so.","You are becoming the interpreter of the enemy’s secret; you implant mistaken thoughts in his heart.","You are setting fire to the thicket, and at the same time uttering complaints.","It may be thought that you have been cruelly wronged, you are making uproar and complaint like the weak.","You are the sun — who will oppress you?","You do whatever you desire from on high.","You make us envious of one another; you make our quarreling into a fine spectacle.","To the gnostics you give wine as cash-in-hand; the ascetics you make drunk with tomorrow.","You give sorrow to the death-meditating bird; the bolbols you make drunk and singing.","You make the raven desirous of dung; your parrot you make sugar-cracking.","The one you draw into mine and mountain, the other you set face to the sea.","You lead us to happiness by way of suffering, or else you recompense our slip.","In this sea all is profit and justice; you dispense all beneficence and kindness.","This is the head of the subtlety; you speak its end, though you make us be without foot and head.","Welcome, melody — you are that melody which has brought a sign from the spiritual world.","Pass by the ear and strike upon our souls, lor you are the life of this dead world.","Ravish the soul and go aloft into that world where you have carried the heart.","Your laughing moon bears evidence that you have quaffed that heavenly wine.","Your sweet soul gives a sign that you were nourished in honey from Alast.","Blades have begun to sprout from the earth to show the sowings that you have made.","You are both candle and fair one and wine, likewise spring in the midst of December.","Every side through love of you is one with feathers ablaze, the sun, and myriads like him.","Since your fire always falls upon the reed, sugar has gone through this passion into the soul of the reed.","You have beheaded myriads with love so that the soul has not the strength to say, Ah, alas!","The lovers have built from the evil of the eye underground houses like the city of Rayy.","There is no worse forture than knowledge; alas for him who remains in good and evil.","Those women of Egypt in their unselfedness suffered wounds and did not utter Woe!","The king in unselfedness on the night of Ascension traversed a road of a hundred thousand years.","With the wind of selflessness break the prison of bone and sinew and tendon.","io Shams-i Tabriz!, annihilate us, for you are as the sun and we are as the shadow.","Do you know where you have come?","From the midst of allglorious sanctuary.","Do you not remember at all those happy spiritual stages?","Those things have become forgotten by you, so necessarily you are bewildered and distraught.","You sell my soul for a handful of dust; what kind of bargain and sale is this?","Give back the dust, and know your own worth; you are not a slave, you are a king, an emperor.","For your sake there came out of heaven the fair-faced ones, the sweetly hidden.","You who are imam oflove, say Allah Akbar, for you are drunk; shake your two hands, become indifferent to existence.","You were fixed to a time, you made haste; the time of prayer has come.","Leap up — why are you seated?","In hope of the qibla of God you carve a hundred qibla', in hope of that idol’s love you worship a hundred idols.","Fly upwards, O soul, O obedient soul; the moon is above, the shadow is low.","Do not like a beggar knock your hand at any door; knock at the ring of the door of heaven, for you have a long arm.","Since the flagon of heaven has made you like that, be a stranger to the world, for you have escaped out of self.","I say to you, How are you?","No one ever says to the howless soul, How are you?","Tonight you are drunk and dissolute, come tomorrow and you will see what bags you have forn, what glasses you have broken.","Every glass I have broken was my trust in you, for myriadwise you have bound up the broken.","secret artist, in the depths of your soul you have a thousand forms, apart from the moon and the Lady of the Moon [MahastI].","If you have stolen the ring, you have opened a thousand throats; if you have wounded a breast, you have given a hundred souls and hearts.","have gone mad; whatever I say in madness, quickly say, Yes, yes, if you are privy to Alast.","In the battle ranks we have no shield before our lace; in the concert we are unaware of reed pipe and tambourine.","We are naught in his love, dust at the foot of his love; we are love fold upon fold, we are all love, nothing else.","When we have obliterated ourselves we become altogether love; when surmeh is pounded, it is nothing but the source of sight.","Every body that has become an accident has become the soul and heart of self-interest.","Melt for of all sicknesses, there is nothing worse than being congealed.","Out of desire of that melting and love for that cherishing the liver within me has turned all to blood; I have no liver any more.","My heart is broken into a hundred pieces, my heart has become astray; today if you search, there is no trace of heart in me.","Look at the orb of the moon, waning every day, so that in the dark period you might say there is no moon in the sky.","The increasing leanness of that moon derives from nearness to the sun; when afar, it is full-bodied, but such initiative does not belong to it.","O king, for the sake of the souls send Venus as a minstrel; this soft pipe and tambourine are no match for the concert of the souls.","No, no — for what is Venus when the Sun itself is powerless?","to be suitable for such ardor is not in the power of any lute or sun.","Yesterday you made compact and repentance, today you have broken them; yesterday you were a bitter sea, today you are a pearl.","Yesterday you were Ba Yazld and were augmenting; today you are in ruins, a dregs-seller and drunk.","Drink the dregs, O soul!","Break from reason, O soul!","Do not wear blue, O soul, until you worship idols.","Today you are very dissolute, you share the cup with the sun; You are not the master of the moon, nor the husband of the lady.","You are greater than dwellings, you are outside mines; you are not that, but you are just as you are.","One corner you were bound up, of that corner you were sick; you opened that which was bound and escaped wholly, escaped.","A beast is not a rider, it is only for the sake of labor; you are no beast, you are a living man and you have leaped from labor, leaped.","You are a heavenly messenger; how can you be like the moon until you ride aloft and are in the hand of the thumbstall?","Silence, give no sign, though you expressed everything; every wounded one you have wounded has become the salve of a world.","Minstrel, when you draw your plectrums over the strings, you draw into labor these idlers of the way.","Love, when you enter, you draw these tarriers in the world of separation to the Beloved.","Despite the highwaymen you make the world secure, you drag to the gallows the thieves of the heart city.","You see the cunning schemer, and cunningly blind him; when you see the friend, you draw him into the cave.","You bind a golden saddle on the nimble-footed horses; the evil pack-horses you draw to the baggage.","You cherish our melancholic ones every moment; our market-minded ones you drag very miserably.","To the thorn-enduring lovers you show the rose bower; you draw into the thorns the self-willed whose joy is but for a moment.","To him who enters the fire you give access to the water; he who runs to water, you drag him into the flames.","To Moses, dusty of face, you give the way to glory; Pharaoh, the seeker of pomp, you draw into disgrace.","This reversed horseshoe acts without how and why; Moses the stick-seeker, you draw into a serpent.","Yesterday I clutched his skirt saying, O essence [jewel] of generosity, do not say goodnight, do not grieve us, for tonight you are mine.","The darling face lit up and glowed red like a spark.","He said, That is enough; draw back.","How long with this beggar’s ways?","I said, God’s Messenger said: ‘Seek your need of the handsome, if you desire to attain it.’ He said, The fair of face is self-willed and bad-tempered, for beauty permits plenty of airs and wickedness.","I said, If that is so, his wickedness is the life of the soul, because whenever you try it, it is the talisman of the mine"," He said, This is a raw talk; who is the handsome?","This color and form is a snare, it is cunning and inconstancy.","When a man possesses not the soul of the soul, know that he possesses not that; many a man delivers his soul with the form of mortality.","I said, Pretty of cheek, bring nonexistence into existence; change our copper to gold, you who are the soul of alchemy.","Copper must yield itself to discover the alchemy: you are a grain of corn, but you are outside the mill.","He said, You are ungrateful, you are ignorant of copper; you are in doubt and conjecture from the things you show.","I began weeping wretchedly.","I said, You have the rule, come to the succor of your lover, O source oflight.","When he saw his servant’s tears he began to laugh; East and West came to life through that grace and familiarity.","Fellow travelers and friends, weep like a cloud, so that fair ones may bring their sweet presence into the garden.","Once again a melody has come from the reed pipe of fortune; O soul, clap hands, O heart, stamp feet.","A mine has become aglow, a world is laughing, a table is adorned, invitation is coming.","We are drunlc and roaring in hope of the spring over the meadow, adoring one of handsome cheek.","He is the sun, we are a cloud; he the treasure, we a ruin; in the light of a sea we are as motes.","I am distracted, I am excused; suffer me to brag — with the light of Mustafa I will split the moon.","You who are weary of us, we are very desirous; you who have withdrawn from the road, where is the courtesy of fellowtraveling?","You are the marrow of the world, the rest is all hay; how shall a man get fat on eating hay?","Every city which is ruined and turned upside down, that has happened because it remained far from the royal shadow.","When the sun has gone, what remains?","Black night.","When reason has gone from the head, what remains but idiocy?","Reason, the riot that has befallen, all springs from your departure: and then you attribute the fault to a body without reason.","Wherever you turn your back, there is error and war; whenever you show your face, there is drunkenness and stupefaction.","The eighteen thousand worlds are of two divisions only — half dead, inanimate matter, and half conscious.","The sea of consciousness from which all minds derive, that is the goal of all finite minds.","Swimming soul, who go in this sea, and you who leap from this wheel like an arrow — io By the tent of your body a world is illuminated; so how can you be, you spirit of the tent!","Spirit, eternity is intoxicated by your wine; in your hand, earth is transmuted to pure gold; Your description evades the understanding of the vulgar, incomparable one, and transcends the likeness of the imagination of one who likens you.","If any lover through yearning assigns a form to you, the sea of transcendence would not be made impure.","If the babbling poets compare the crescent moon to a horseshoe, the moon does not lose its moonliness.","How could the sea remain a barrier in the path before Moses?","and could the blind remain blind in the protection of Jesus?","He is the master of all, even if he has not one slave; that cypress of his is erect, even though you count it as not erect.","You are Moses, though still the shepherd; you are Joseph, though still in the well.","You do not receive the wages for labor because you are not always engaged in this labor, but only casually.","Silence, for without God’s food and wine from the unseen these words and images are but two or three empty bowls.","Bird-catcher, you have set a hidden snare; over the snare you have laid smoke -colored fabric.","Too many thousands of birds you have slain by this trick and laid all the feathers plucked as a sign.","The birds that are your watchmen make a great cry; what meanings you have planted in their cries!","For the thirsty birds you have placed in the taverns of your proximity vats of Magian wines.","That vat, the scent of which neither saki nor drunkard catches, you have laid down for the sake of the nightfarer that you know.","In patience and penitence you have compounded the immunity of the shield; in cruelty and wrath you have set a lance.","Without the danger of lance and shield, you have implanted for the pious believers a kingdom in the seven oft-repeated verses.","Under the black of the eye you have made the wave of light flow, and in that aged world you have set youthfulness.","In the breast which fashions forms out of imagination, you have placed a finger without pen and finger, io Though so many veils of flesh and sinew lie over the heart, you have given the heart penetration and visible passage.","Which is stranger — the glance that flies like an arrow, or the brow you have set as a bow?","Or that in vessel-like bodies you implanted various characters like wines bitter and sweet, Or that this secret liquor distilled from the tongue you have placed on the tongue as the cream of speech?","Every essence and accident is as a mouth-shut bud which you have set as a veil over the cradle of virgins.","On the day when you cause them to blossom and remove those veils, O soul of the soul of the soul, what soul you will have implanted!","Restless hearts will see for what reason in separation you have placed entreaty and yearning.","Silence, that that soul may speak the spoken things; why have you implanted this long conjury?","You swore an oath that henceforth you would be cruel; now you break your oath and finish with cruelty.","Today we have seized your skirt and are drawing; how long will you offer pretexts and cheat?","Idol, that lip of yours is smiling and giving good tidings that you have resolved henceforward to be true","Since without you entreaty is not proper for us, what profits it?","It is only proper when you vouchsafe the need.","Without your sea we flounder like fish on the land — so fish do when you part them from water.","The tyrant is cruel and the prisoner terrifies him with you; god does with you what you do in our case!","When you are cruel, with whom shall anyone terrify you?","only he who submits to whatever you demand.","Silence, do not sell the unique pearl; how do you fix a price for that which is without value?","Reed, very sweet it is that you know the secrets; that one does the work who has knowledge of the work.","Reed, like the bulbul you are lamenting for the rose; do not scratch your neck, for you know the thornless rose.","I said to the reed, You share the beloved’s breath; do not steal the secret [from me].","The reed said, Knowledge is for your total destruction.","I said, My salvation is in my destruction; set fire, burn, do not leave knowledge.","He said, How shall I be a brigand on this caravan?","I know that knowledge is the leader.","I said, Since the Beloved cherished not those gone astray, knowledge has become disgusted with itself.","You who are unaware of self, you have nine eyes; awareness is for us the veil of eyes and sight.","You are a companion of the lip because you have been beheaded; in this way head is a shame, and knowledge a disgrace.","You have become empty of self and full of secrets because you are aware of self- worshiping and unbelief.","What lament, when you drink of the ruby lips of the beloved?","Let knowledge utter this bitter lament.","No, no, you do not lament of yourself, noble one; weep for him who is aware of others.","If heaven laments, the ox is under the load; you are aware of this reversed deceptive horseshoe.","You who slay like sugar the lovers, slay my soul sweetly this moment, if you are slaying.","To slay sweetly and gently is the property of your hand, because you slay with a glance he who seeks a glance.","Every morning continuously I am waiting, waiting, because you generally slay me at dawn.","Your cruelty to us is candy; do not close the way to assistance.","Is it not the case that at the end you will slay me in front of the gate?","You whose breath is without a belly, you whose sorrow repels sorrow, you who slay us in a breath like a spark, Every moment you proffer another repulse like a shield; you have abandoned the sword and are slaying with the shield.","Lion-heart, you have made a hundred thousand lion-hearts; you have outstripped the sun even in generosity.","Close your eyes, and have compassion once more; break your oath, if you have sworn by God.","See that these enemies are clapping their hands, since in this rage and warlike mood you have stamped your foot.","With whom is your inclination, O soul?","— so that I may become his dust, so that I may become the servant of him whom you have reckoned somebody.","Body, at last stir yourself and make an effort.","Effort is blessed; why are you languid?","Rise, approach the friend; set your face to the earth, saying, Idol sweet as sugar, by what are you vexed?","Master of the soul, Shams-i Din of Tabrizi, this head of mine is of your palm tree for it was nourished by you.","O soul, the breeze of spring is coming, so that you may raise your hand towards the rose garden.","Grass and lily, tulip and hyacinth said, There grows whatever you sow.","Buds and rose blossoms came as a helmet so that the ugliness of the thorn may not appear.","Elevation has come to the tall cypress, it has found glory after humiliation.","Spirit enters all the garden, for water displays spiritbestowing; The beauty of the garden increases from water — it has come as most blessed friendship.","Leaf has sent a message to fruit, You come quickly, do not scratch your ear.","That sweet grape is king of the fruits, because its tree was emaciated.","In the winter of lust how long shall the garden of our heart remain imprisoned and walled in?","io Seek the way from the heart, seek the moon from the soul; what does the earth possess but dust?","Rise, wash your face, but with a water which beautifies the cheek of the rose.","The branch of blossoms said to the basil, Lay down whatever you possess in our path.","The nightingale said to the garden, We are the quarry of your snare.","The rose entreats God for mercy, Do not put winter in command over us.","God says, How does juice come out of fruit until you squeeze it?","Do not grieve over December and the raiding Ghuzz, and regard this business as lying at my door.","Thanks and praise, joy and increase do not appear except you lament.","I will give you life unnumbered if I take away numbered life; I will give you wine without hangover if I take away wine that yields hangover.","How many pictures hath knowledge, why do you go on painting its pages?","Through you the face of the pages has been blackened; how can you read the writing of day?","Have done with smoke; look at the light from the moon of the Beloved in the dark night.","Enough, enough, come down from your horse, so that he may ride forth, the horseman supreme.","The Buraq of the love of realities carried away my mind and heart; ask me where it took them?","Thither you do not know.","I reached that arch where I saw neither moon nor sky, that world where even world is parted from world.","Give me respite for a moment for my mind to return to me; I will describe the soul to you — give ear, for you are the soul.","But approach nearer, my master, lay your ear on my mouth; for walls have ears, and this is a secret mystery.","It is a loving care from the Beloved, this so strange a grace; the lamps of vision enter by way of the ear.","Accompany the khidr of reason to the fountain of life, so that like the fountain of the sun by day you scatter light.","As Zulaikha became young through the intention of Joseph, so the ancient world recovers its youth from this star.","The Canopus of the soul swallows moon, sun and pole of the seven skies when he rises from the Yemeni pillar.","Take for a moment a clipping of faith and place it under your tongue that you may see how inwardly you are a mine of gold!","You have fallen into the mouths and men are chewing you; since you are a fine and well-baked bread, you are always the same.","You dance like a mote when light takes your hand; it is out of coldness and wetness that you are heavy as sand.","When the sun rises it says to the dark earth, Since I became your companion, you are a master of double conjunction.","You are not a goat to come and play the rearing horse; you are a shepherd like a raging lion before the herd of lions.","Light up the five lamps of your senses with the light of the heart; the senses are as the five prayers, the heart like the seven oft-repeated verses.","Every dawn a cry comes out of the heavens, When you settle the dust of the road, you lead the way to a sign.","So draw not back the reins of resolution like a hermaphrodite; ahead of you are two armies toward which you advance like a lance.","Sugar has come to you, saying, Open your mouth; why have you closed your mouth like a pistachio to the sugar’s invitation?","Take the bowl of sugar; eat by the bowlful — may you enjoy it!","Do not beat the drum of legend — why do you give in to the tongue?","Through Shams, Pride of Tabriz, you worship the sun, for he is the sun of spiritual sciences, the governor of the sun of place.","You are my heaven, I am the earth in astonishment; every moment what things have you set growing in my heart.","I am the dry-lipped earth; rain that water of grace.","Of your water earth discovers rose and rose garden.","What does the earth know, what have you sown in its heart?","it is pregnant by you, and you know what it is bearing.","Every atom is pregnant by you with another mystery; for a while you writhe with the pregnant women in agony.","What things are in the womb of this enfolded earth from which are born I am the truth and the cry Glory to me!","now it groans, and a camel is born of its womb; a staff falls and takes the way of serpenthood.","The prophet said, Know the believer is like a camel, always drunk with God who looks after his camel.","Now he brands him, and now sets provender before him; now he binds his knees with the shackle of reason, And now he loosens his knees to dance like a camel, to rend asunder the bridle and go in disarray.","See how the meadow can not contain itself for joy, since the spiritual garden has given it so many forms.","See the power of the Universal Soul to impart understanding, so that through it the dullard earth has become a spiritual shaper.","Like the Universal Soul, the whole plenum is a veil or curtain of the Sun of Majesty who has no second, The eternal Sun which never sets, the light of whose face is neither of the Aquarius nor of Libra.","One by one all that He sowed is appearing.","Silence, for the oyster shells are pregnant with the divine pearls.","The lord of beauty and quintessence ofloveliness entered the soul and mind as a man will stroll in the garden at spring.","Come, come, for you are the life and salvation of men; come, come, for you are the eye and lamp of Jacob.","Lay foot on my water and clay, for through your foot darkness and veiledness depart from water and clay.","Through your glow stones turn to rubies, through your searching the searcher reaches his goal.","Come, come, for you bestow beauty and glory; come, come, for you are the cure of a thousand Jobs.","Come, come, though you have never departed, but I speak every word to you for a desired end.","Sit in the place of my soul, for you are a thousand times my soul; slay your paramour and lover, for you are the Beloved.","If the king is not the king of the world, O melancholy world, by His life I bid you say, Why are you in confusion?","Now you are gay and fresh with His green banner, and now you are overturned by the heart of His army of battle.","Now, like the thought of an artist, you fashion forms; now you sweep carpets like the broom of the porter.","When you sweep a form, you give its quintessence angelhood, and the wings and pinions of the cherubim.","Silence, guard the water strictly like a waterbag, for if you sprinkle it through a crack, know that you are at fault.","Your heart has reached Shams, the Pride of Tabriz, because the Duldul of the heart proved itself a nimble mount.","Finally you have broken away and departed into the Unseen; i wonder, I wonder — by which way did you depart from the world?","You beat your feathers and wings mightily and broke your cage; you took the air and departed towards the spiritual world.","You were a special falcon in captivity to an old woman; when you heard the falcon-drum, you departed to the placeless.","You were a drunken nightingale amongst owls; the scent of the rose garden arrived, you departed to the rose garden.","You suffered much crop sickness from this sour ferment; finally you departed to the eternal tavern.","You went straight as an arrow to the target of bliss; you flew to that target and departed from this bow.","This world like a ghoul gave you false clues; you took no heed of the clue and departed to the clueless.","Since you have become the sun, what have you to do with a crown?","Since you have departed from the middle, why do you seek a belt?","I have heard tell of gazing on the soul when the eyes are extinguished; why do you gaze on the soul, since you have departed to the soul of soul?","O heart, what a rare bird you are, that in hunting for the AllGrateful you departed towards the lance with two wings like a shield.","The rose flees from autumn; ah, what a bold rose you are, that you went creeping along before the autumn wind.","Like rain from heaven on the roof of the earthly world you ran in every direction and departed by the spout.","Be silent, suffer not the anguish of speech; sleep on, for you have departed into the shelter of such a loving friend.","Come, come, for you will not find another friend like me; where indeed in both worlds is a beloved like me?","Come, come, and do not pass your days in every direction, for there is no other market elsewhere for your money.","You are like a dry water conduit and I am like the rain; you are like a ruined city and I am like the architect.","Except in serving me, which is the sunrise of joy, men have never seen and never will see any mark of happiness.","In sleep you see a thousand moving forms; when sleep has gone, you see not a single creature.","Close the eye of wrong and open the eye of intelligence, for the carnal soul has fallen like an ass, and concupiscence is the halter.","Seek sweet syrup from the garden oflove, for human nature is a vinegar-seller and a crusher of unripe grapes.","Come to the hospital of your Creator, for no sick man can do without that physician.","The world without that king is like the body without its head; wind round such a head as a turban, io If you are not black, let not the mirror go from your hand; for the soul is your mirror and the body is rust.","Where is the lucky merchant with Jupiter in ascension, that I may do that business with him and purchase his goods?","Come, think of me who gave you thought; if you are buying rubies, at least buy from my mine.","Go on foot towards him who gave you a foot, gaze on him with both eyes who gave you sight.","Clap hands for joy for him from whose sea is the foam, for there is no grief or sorrow happening to him.","Listen without ears; speak unto him without a tongue, for the speech of the tongue is not without contradiction and injury.","If you have no beloved, why do you not seek one?","And if you have attained the Beloved, why do you not rejoice?","If the companion is not compliant, why do you not become him?","If the rebec wails not, why do you not teach it manners?","If an Abu Jahl is a veil to you, why do you not attack Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab?","You sit idly saying, This is a strange business; you are the strange one not to desire such a strange one.","You are the sun of the world; why are you black at heart?","See that you do not any more have a desire for the knot [of Draco].","Like gold you are prisoner in the furnace so that you may not be covetous of the purse of gold.","Since Unity is the bachelor’s chamber of those who say One, why do you not make your spirit a bachelor to all but god?","Have you ever seen Majnun have affection with two LailTs?","Why not desire only one face and one chin?","There is such a moon in hiding in the night of your being; why do you not pray and petition at midnight?","Though you are an ancient drunkard and not new to the wine, God’s wine does not suffer you not to make turmoil.","My wine is the fire oflove, especially from the hand of God; may life be unlawful to you, since you do not make your life firewood.","Though the wave of discourse is surging, yet it is better that you should expound it with heart and soul, not with lips.","Heart, you are the phoenix of union.","Fly, why do you not fly?","No one recognizes you, neither man nor peri.","You are the sweetheart, not the heart; but with every device and trickery you have taken the shape of the heart so that you will ravish a thousand hearts.","For a moment faithfully you mingle with earth, and for a moment you pass beyond empyrean and firmament and the bounds of the two worlds.","Why does not spirit find you, for you are its wings and feathers?","Why does not sight see you who are the source of sight?","What power has penitence to repent of you?","What is consciousness that it should remain conscious along with you?","What shall be that poor copper when the alchemy comes?","Will it not pass away from copperhood into the attribute of gold?","Who is that poor seed when the springtime comes?","Does not its seedhood pass away into treehood?","Who is poor brushwood when it falls into the fire?","Is not the brushwood transformed into a spark by the flame?","All reason and science are stars; are you the sun of the world who tear asunder their veils?","The world is like snow and ice, and you are the season of summer; when you, king, are on its track, no trace of it remains.","Say, who am I to remain along with you?","I and a hundred like me will pass away when you gaze towards me.","The perfection of the description of the lord Shams-i Tabriz!","surpasses the imaginations of predestinator and free-wilier.","We have come once again to a lord to whose knee no sea reaches.","Tie together a thousand minds, they will not reach Him; how shall a hand or foot reach the moon in heaven?","The sky stretched out its throat eagerly to Him; it found no kiss, but it swallowed a sweetmeat.","A thousand throats and gullets stretched towards His lip.","Scatter too on our heads manna and quails.","We have come again to a Beloved, from whose air a shout has reached our ears.","We have come again to that sanctuary to bow the brow which is to surpass the skies.","We have come again to that meadow to whose bolbol ‘anqa is a slave.","We have come to Him who was never apart from us; for the waterbag is never filled without the existence of a watercarrier.","The bag always clings to the body of the water-carrier, saying, Without you, I have no hand or knowledge or opinion.","We have come again to that feast with the sweet dessert of which the sugarcane chewer attained his desire.","We have come again to that sphere, in whose bent the soul roars like thunder.","We have come again to that love at whose contact the div has become peri-lilce.","Silence!","Seal the rest under your tongue, for a jealous tutor has been put in charge of you.","Speak not of the talk of the Pride of Tabriz, Shams-i Din, for the rational mind is not suitable for that speech.","Leap, leap from the world, that you may be king of the world; seize the sugar tray that you may be a sugar plantation.","Leap, leap like a meteor to slay the div; when you leap out of stardom, you will be the pole of heaven.","When Noah sets out for the sea, you will be his ship; when the Messiah goes to heaven, you will be the ladder.","Now like Jesus of Mary you become the soul’s physician; and now like Moses of ‘Emran you will go forth to be a shepherd.","There is a spiritual fire for the sake of cooking you; if you leap back like a woman, you will be a raw cuckold.","If you do not flee from the fire, and become wholly cooked like well-baked bread, you will be a master and lord of the table.","When you come to the table and the brethren receive you, like bread you will be sustenance of the soul and you will be the soul.","Though you are the mine of pain, by patience you will become the treasure; though you are a flawed house, you will be a knower of the unseen.","I said this, and a call came from heaven to my spirit’s ear saying, If you become like this, you will be like that.","Silence!","the mouth is intended for cracking sugar, not for you to cast slack and become a chin-wagger."]
